00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.340
I am Nikolai Gogol.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.210
Born in 1809, in Poltava gubernia, Ukraine.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.250
I am one of the most famous Russian writers
of Ukrainian origin.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.560
Having graduated from the Nizhyn Lyceum, I
left for Saint Petersburg in 1828 armed with

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.250
a manuscript and hope for a successful literary
career.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.769
My aspirations were abruptly arrested by extremely
negative criticism of my sentimentally Romantic

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.619
narrative poem Hans Kuechelgarten.

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.550
Those were challenging days that led to big
changes in my life.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.050
While working as a minor civil servant, I
spent my free time composing short stories

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.890
based on my observations and memories of life
in Ukraine.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.720
This brought me immediate fame.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.770
Hiding behind the authorial mask of Rudy Panko
the beekeeper, I managed to portray a world

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.890
where fantasy and reality intermingle in the
prism of the worldly-wise but unsophisticated

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.200
narrator, and thus Ukraine becomes at once
fanciful, humorous, nostalgic, and somewhat

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.770
poignant in its quaintness.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.540
A work of mine called “The staging of The
Inspector-General” did not produce the result

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.920
I intended.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.370
Shattered by the fact that my idea of the
moral influence of true art, I left Russia.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.479
The years abroad were less productive.

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.539
I tried to escape depression through other
works such as Dead Souls and The Overcoat.

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.700
Disillusioned by the attacks that followed
my publications, I blamed myself for being

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.060
incapable of producing morally ennobling art.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.509
Seeking refuge, I went on a pilgrimage to
Jerusalem, Palestine.

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.329
I enter a monastery and burned the second
part of Dead Souls, refused all food, and

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.380
stayed in bed until my death.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.289
My works display different variations of the
Romantic style and masterly use of metaphor,

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.970
hyperbole, and ironic grotesque.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.819
I was the first writer of the so-called Ukrainian
school in Russian literature to employ a host

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:56.270
of lexical and syntactic Ukrainianisms, primarily
to play with various stylistic levels from

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.250
the vulgar to the pathetic.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.539
There are hundreds of translations of my works,
and I am recognized as one of the greatest

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.049
writers of the 19th century.

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.929
Always think of what is useful and not what
is beautiful.

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.420
Beauty will come of its own accord.
