00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:11.940
I am Confucius, A Chinese philosopher born
in 551 BC. I am considered one of the greatest

2
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.900
thinkers in the world. During time of chaos
and war, I set new standards in politics,

3
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.340
morality and philosophy. I became a statesman
in China of 6 century BCE, and created the

4
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.330
social foundations of modern civilized China.
My teachings and philosophy formed the basis

5
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.570
of East Asian culture and society, and remain
influential today.

6
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.370
I am from the zhu dynasty. My teachings of
moral social political and philosophical behavior

7
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.280
in theory would later become the foundation
of a system known as Confucianism. My teachings

8
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.390
were studied and written about from the time
of my death until the founding of the first

9
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:59.039
Chinese Empire in 221 BC.
My wisdom included humaneness towards others,

10
00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.910
ritual and etiquette in addition to love of
parents for their children and of children

11
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.470
for their parents. An emphasis was placed
on self-cultivation and skilled judgment rather

12
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.000
than a knowledge of rules. My ethical ideals
and teachings were also communicated through

13
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.530
metaphor innuendo and anecdotal story. Confucianism
rose to prominence during the Han Dynasty

14
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.729
around 200 BC.
Many followers practiced my teachings as a

15
00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:32.439
religion, however, because it lacks a metaphysical
aspect, most consider Confucianism as an influential

16
00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:39.810
social philosophy. I avidly promoted an autocratic
social structure. In the years after my death,

17
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.220
rulers looked to scholars of Confucianism
for assistance in managing their empires and

18
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.070
governing their people. Confucianism was appealing
to rulers who found that its principles would

19
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.619
essentially help society become self-regulating.
these principles of behavior and their implementation

20
00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.540
are thought to have later influenced strong
central rule and the absence of rigidly enforced

21
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.340
legal structure. I spent my final years teaching
my followers and communicating my wisdom.

22
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.980
these dialogues would eventually become a
set of texts called the five classics.

23
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:22.350
I died at the age of 73 in the year 479 BCE.
I followed what my heart desired without overstepping

24
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.410
the line. I rejoiced in life because life
astonished me, and the will in all living

25
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.860
things to carry on in spite of setbacks and
afflictions inspired me. For you I say, wheresoever

26
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.949
you go, go with all your heart.
