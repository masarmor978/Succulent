00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.850
I am Volodymyr Vernadsky.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.400
Born in 1863 in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.200
Pioneering geochemist, mineralogist, crystallographer,
philosopher of science, political activist,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.640
and politician; full member of Ukrainian Academy
of Sciences from 1918, and a member of Czechoslovak,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.749
Yugoslav, French Academy of Sciences.

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:28.470
After graduating from Saint Petersburg University,
I did graduate work there and in Munich and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.529
Paris and was elected president of the United
Council of Regional Student Organizations

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.300
in the Russian Empire.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.980
I had close genealogical, personal, and intellectual
links to Ukraine.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.370
I spent part of nearly every summer in Poltava
gubernia.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.450
In 1890, I researched the soils of Kremenchuk
county as a member of the soil-science expedition.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.720
After the February Revolution of 1917, I chaired
the Agricultural Scholarly Committee of the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.990
Russian Ministry of Agriculture.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.560
After the Bolshevik coup, I fled to Ukraine.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.060
In 1918, at the behest of Mykola Vasylenko
and the Hetman government, I headed the group

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.409
of Ukrainian scholars that drafted the detailed
project for founding the Ukrainian Academy

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.040
of Sciences.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.299
In 1919, while visiting Rostov-na-Donu, I
was unable to return to Ukraine and ended

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.190
up locked in Crimea, where I was a professor
and rector of Tavriia University in Simferopol

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.190
in 1920.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.119
In 1921 I returned to Petrograd and organized
the Radium Institute there and worked in Paris

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.079
with Marie Curie and lectured at the Sorbonne.

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.729
Under Soviet rule, I was a spokesman for preserving
the academy's autonomy and for freedom of

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.689
thought and travel.

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.429
In the 1930s I headed the academy's new commissions
on the Permafrost and Heavy Water, began the

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.439
building of the first Soviet cyclotron, and
oversaw the development of Soviet radiogeology

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.729
and biochemistry.

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.829
In 1940 I co-founded the academy's Uranium
Commission and was elected its vice-chairman.

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:59.069
My ideas became the core of new directions
in geology, mineralogy, and hydrogeology,

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.709
and I am regarded as the founder of Soviet
geochemistry and biogeochemistry.

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:08.530
I wrote extensively about philosophical issues
in science, popularized the concepts of the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.730
biosphere and noosphere, and developed radiological
and radiochemical concepts.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.650
My work has served humanity during my lifetime
and I hope it is still yielding fruitfully.
