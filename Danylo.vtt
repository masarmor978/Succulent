00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:09.600
I am Danylo born in 1201 in Halych, western&nbsp;
Ukraine. I am the prince of Volhynia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.480
Galicia, and the Principality of&nbsp;
Galicia-Volhynia of the Romanovych dynasty.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.440
I am also known as the king of Rusâ€™.
After the death of my father,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.560
Prince Roman Mstyslavych, in 1205,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.920
unrest among the boyars forced me to take refuge&nbsp;
at the Hungarian court with my mother and brother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.880
Following a long struggle with&nbsp;
neighboring princes and Galician boyars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.080
I unified Volhynia and gained control over Halych&nbsp;
in 1238, with the support of the burghers. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.480
next year I took Kyiv. My influence reached to the&nbsp;
Turiv-Pynsk principality and the Dorohychyn land.&nbsp;

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.960
My plans to unify Ukrainian territories were&nbsp;
interfered by the Mongol destruction of Kyiv,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.280
Volodymyr and Halych. I was nevertheless able&nbsp;
to defeat a coalition of the Chernihiv princes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.480
disaffected boyars, and their Hungarian and&nbsp;
Polish allies at the Battle of Yaroslav and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.480
finally established my control over Galicia.
In order to save my state, I was compelled to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.760
recognize khan's suzerainty. I sent&nbsp;
raids against the Mongols' vassals,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.320
built fortifications, and sought alliances in&nbsp;
the West, particularly with Pope Innocent IV. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.440
later alliance did not bring the aid I had hoped&nbsp;
for and had no practical consequences. In 1254 I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.880
repulsed a Mongol attack on Ponyzia and Volhynia.&nbsp;
The Mongol leader, Burundai, led a new campaign&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.880
in 1260, forcing me to dismantle my fortifications&nbsp;
and abandon my plans for independence.&nbsp;

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.240
I was an exceptionally gifted ruler. For a time,&nbsp;
I unified the western territories of Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.400
I built a number of new cities,&nbsp;
including my new capital, Kholm,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.760
and Lviv. Also, I reformed the military forces,&nbsp;
creating a heavy infantry based on the peasantry;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.960
and gained control over the boyars.
By my death in 1264,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.600
I had reconstructed and expanded the&nbsp;
territories held by my father, held off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.520
the expansionist threats of Poland and Hungary,&nbsp;
minimized Mongol influence on Western Ukraine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.132
and raised the economic and social standards of&nbsp;
my domains. Let our nation glow till eternity.
