00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.880
I am Kiyoshi Atsumi, or as referred by my
fans, Tora San, born in 1928.

2
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.490
I am the main actor of the TV series that
holds the Guinness World Record for the longest-running

3
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.199
movie series starring a single actor known
as , "It's tough being a man”.

4
00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.659
It resembles a kind-hearted vagabond who is
always unlucky in love.

5
00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:30.849
It spans over 48 installments released between
1969 and 1995.

6
00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.170
Each film featured a different leading lady,
called a Madonna, and a different region of

7
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.170
Japan.

8
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.920
Two films were usually made each year between
1969 and 1989, one for summer and one for

9
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.840
New Year release.

10
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.750
From 1990 to 1995 only one film was made each
year.

11
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.469
The longest series almost came to an end in
1996 with my health declining from lung cancer

12
00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.199
at age 68, without Tora-san ever settling
down and finding domestic happiness.

13
00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.590
I was so identified with the Tora-san character
that my death was also considered by fans

14
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.590
to be the death of Tora-san.

15
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.940
In 2019, the 50th Tora-san film named, Wish
You Were Here, was released.

16
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.390
I appeared throughout the film as flashbacks,
using footage from my dozens of performances

17
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.640
as Tora-san in the previous films, with the
cast members in contemporary Tokyo recalling

18
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.510
my presence in their lives.

19
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.800
Maybe my deepest message in my acting was
that we shouldn’t always seek answers and

20
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.170
run blindly to our goals.

21
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.800
I deliberately refrained from taking things
too far.

22
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.300
This is because I understood very well that
pursuing things to their conclusion does not

23
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.580
always lead to happiness.

24
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.400
Maybe those values do not hold these days
but I hope my memory placed true smile and

25
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.300
warmth in many people hearts!

26
00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.250
Excuse me, I have to meet Sakura over there,
isn’t she beautiful?
