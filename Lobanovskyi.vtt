I am Valeriy Lobanovskyi. Born in 1939 in Kyiv,&nbsp;
Ukraine. I am а Ukrainian football player and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.520
manager. I was awarded the FIFA Order of Merit,&nbsp;
the highest honor awarded by FIFA. In 2002,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.360
I was awarded the Hero of Ukraine&nbsp;
award, my nation's highest honor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.920
for my contribution to Ukrainian football.
I studied at the Kyiv school that was named&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.720
after me in the upcoming years. In&nbsp;
1956 I joined the Kyiv Polytechnic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.760
Institute but later transferred to the Odessa&nbsp;
Polytechnic Institute, where I graduated.&nbsp;

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.520
I am most famous for my spells managing FC&nbsp;
Dynamo Kyiv and the USSR national football team.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.080
I established Dynamo as the most dominant club&nbsp;
in Soviet football in the 1970s and 1980s,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.640
winning the Soviet Top League eight times&nbsp;
and the Soviet Cup six times in 16 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.560
In 1975, my Dynamo Kyiv team became the first&nbsp;
side from the Soviet Union to win a major&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.960
European trophy when they beat the Hungarian&nbsp;
side in the final of the Cup Winners' Cup.&nbsp;

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.440
During the tournament, Dynamo Kyiv won eight&nbsp;
games out of nine, resulting in a winning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.240
percentage of 88 % – a record that stood&nbsp;
for 45 years encompassing all of the major&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.800
European club football competitions. I and my team&nbsp;
repeated our Cup Winners' Cup success in 1986,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.240
beating Atletico Madrid in the final.
After returning to Dynamo Kyiv in 1997&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.040
for the third time, I led the team to another&nbsp;
successful run in a European competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.680
I am is highly regarded due to my achievements&nbsp;
as a coach and am widely considered one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.360
greatest managers of all time. Throughout my&nbsp;
coaching career, I won 33 official trophies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.920
becoming the second most decorated manager&nbsp;
of all time and the most successful football&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.640
manager of the 20th century. I have also&nbsp;
won the Ukrainian championship five times&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.160
out of five – an accomplishment&nbsp;
not matched by any other manager.&nbsp;

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.640
I hold my love for my nation in every&nbsp;
step of my career. My passion led me to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.153
world records that I hope will inspire many&nbsp;
people to follow their dreams and wishes.
