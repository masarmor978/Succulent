00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.600
I am Maria Prymachenko. Born&nbsp;
in 1909 in Bolotnia, Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.280
I am a Ukrainian folk art painter,&nbsp;
who worked in the naïve art style.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.320
A self-taught artist, I worked in&nbsp;
painting, embroidery, and ceramics.&nbsp;

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.000
I am from a peasant family and I spent&nbsp;
the majority of my life in our village.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.120
I attended school for four years, before&nbsp;
contracting polio, leaving me with a physical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.800
impairment, which impacted my life and art. During&nbsp;
childhood, my mother taught me embroidery, and by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.880
the late 1920s or early 1930s, I was a member of&nbsp;
the Ivankiv Co-operative Embroidery Association.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.840
My talent was recognized by the artist&nbsp;
Tetiana Floru, who invited me to work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.640
at the Central Experimental Workshop of&nbsp;
the Kyiv Museum of Ukrainian Art in 1935.&nbsp;

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.640
In Kyiv, I underwent two operations,&nbsp;
which enabled me to stand unaided. Also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.400
I met my partner, Vasyl Marynchuk, there. And&nbsp;
had our son Fedir Prymachenko who became a folk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.000
artist and a master of naiveté. Both my husband&nbsp;
and my brother died during the second world war.&nbsp;

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.200
The 1936 First Republican Exhibition of Folk Art&nbsp;
featured my paintings. This exhibition was shown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.880
in Moscow, Leningrad, Warsaw, and Paris.&nbsp;
I was awarded a first-degree diploma for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.160
participating in this exhibition of folk art.
My works were inspired by Ukrainian and in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.800
particular Polesian, folk traditions.&nbsp;
They include references to the natural&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.760
world and to fairy-tales. I also created&nbsp;
bold and expressive embroidery linework.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.640
I kept developing my style, with paintings having&nbsp;
an increasingly vibrant color palette and a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.600
choice of bright backgrounds for her works.
I was awarded the Taras Shevchenko National&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.280
Prize of Ukraine in addition to&nbsp;
global recognition from UNESCO,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.280
nations, cities, universities, museums, and&nbsp;
global artists and mindsets such as Pablo Picasso.&nbsp;

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.720
I died in 1997 trying to keep the most&nbsp;
beautiful colors I saw in my artworks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.800
Many of my works were burnt during the&nbsp;
Russian aggression against Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.240
Many museums that hold my art were deliberately&nbsp;
set on fire and many of my paintings were lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.768
I hope the world can see&nbsp;
the colors I wanted to save.
