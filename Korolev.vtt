00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.710
I am Sergei Korolev.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.300
Born in 1907 in Zhytomyr, Ukraine.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.200
I was a lead Soviet rocket engineer and spacecraft
designer during the Space Race between the

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.580
United States and the Soviet Union in the
1950s and 1960s.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.570
I am regarded by many as the father of practical
astronautics.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.960
I was involved in the development of the R-7
Rocket, Sputnik 1, launching Laika, Sputnik

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.440
3, Belka and Strelka, and the first human
being, Yuri Gagarin, into space.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.840
As a child, I was stubborn, persistent, and
argumentative.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.620
I grew up a lonely child with few friends
and began reading at an early age, and my

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.140
abilities in mathematics and other subjects
made me a favorite student of my teachers

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.070
but caused jealousy from my peers.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.920
Although I trained as an aircraft designer,
my greatest strengths proved to be in design

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.810
integration, organization, and strategic planning.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.420
I was arrested on a false official charge
as a "member of an anti-Soviet counter-revolutionary

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.009
organization.

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:15.459
I was imprisoned in 1938 for almost six years,
including a few months in a Kolyma labor camp.

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:20.359
Following my release, I became a recognized
rocket designer and a key figure in the development

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:24.389
of the Soviet Intercontinental ballistic missile
program.

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:29.799
I later directed the Soviet space program
and, overseeing first human Earth orbit mission

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.299
by Yuri Gagarin on 1961.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.400
My unexpected death in 1966 interrupted the
implementation of my plans for a Soviet-crewed

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.420
Moon landing before the United Statesâ€™ 1969
mission.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.399
Before my death, I was officially identified
only as the Chief Designer, to protect me

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.169
from possible Cold War assassination attempts
by the United States.

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:59.279
Even some of the cosmonauts who worked with
me were unaware of my last name; I only went

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:01.419
by Chief Designer.

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:07.399
Only following my death in 1966, was my identity
revealed and I received the appropriate public

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.630
recognition as the driving force behind Soviet
accomplishments in space exploration during

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.250
and following the International Geophysical
Year.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.680
Our world is vast and I pushed our observations
a bit closer to its limits.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.070
I hope our sense of exploration is expanding
to this day.
