00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.960
I am Julius Caesar, born in 100 BC in Rome,
Italy. I was politician and general of the

2
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.700
late Roman republic, I greatly extended the
Roman empire before seizing power and paving

3
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.230
the way for the imperial system.
I am from the prestigious Julian clan. My

4
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.050
family were closely connected with the Marian
faction in Roman politics. I progressed within

5
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.230
the Roman political system, becoming in succession
quaestor, aedile and praetor. In 60 BC, I

6
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.220
served as governor of the Roman province of
Spain. Back in Rome in 60, I made a pact with

7
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.480
Pompey and Crassus, who helped me to get elected
as consul for 59 BC. The following year I

8
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.229
was appointed governor of Roman Gaul where
I stayed for eight years, adding the whole

9
00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:49.720
of modern France and Belgium to the Roman
empire, and making Rome safe from the possibility

10
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.799
of Gallic invasions. I made two expeditions
to Britain, in 55 BC and 54 BC.

11
00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.200
I then returned to Italy, disregarding the
authority of the senate, and famously crossing

12
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.750
the Rubicon River without disbanding my army.
In the ensuing civil war, I defeated the republican

13
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.380
forces. Pompey, their leader, fled to Egypt
where he was assassinated. I followed him

14
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.010
and became romantically involved with the
Egyptian queen, Cleopatra.

15
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.190
I was now master of Rome. I used my power
to carry out much-needed reform, relieving

16
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.580
debt, enlarging the senate, building the Forum
Iulium and revising the calendar. Dictatorship

17
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.640
was always regarded a temporary position but
in 44 BC, I took it for life. My success and

18
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.710
ambition alienated strongly republican senators.
A group of these, led by Cassius and Brutus,

19
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.320
assassinated me in 44 BC. This sparked the
final round of civil wars that ended the Republic

20
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.750
and brought about the elevation of my great
nephew and designated heir, Octavian, as Augustus,

21
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.330
the first emperor.
I came to Rome when it was a city of stone

22
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.960
and left it a city of marble. I hope my passion
still live to this day in the hearts of people

23
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.039
of our vast empire.
