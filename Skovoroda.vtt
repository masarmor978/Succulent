00:00:00.305 --> 00:00:09.360
I am Hryhorii Skovoroda, Born in 1722&nbsp;
in Chornukhy, Kharkiv oblast, Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.720
I am a Philosopher and poet.
I was educated at the Kyivan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.500
Mohyla Academy. I spend years in Kharkiv, teaching&nbsp;
poetics, syntax and Greek, and ethics at Kharkiv&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.380
College. Material support from friends enabled&nbsp;
me to devote myself to reflection and writing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.180
Most of my works were dedicated to my friends&nbsp;
and circulated among them in manuscript copies.&nbsp;

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:37.080
In my writings, the purpose of philosophy is&nbsp;
practicalâ€”to show the way to happiness. Hence, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.540
two central questions for me are what happiness is&nbsp;
and how it can be attained. For me, happiness is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.820
an inner state of peace, gaiety, and confidence&nbsp;
that is attainable by all. To reach this state,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.260
some understanding of the world and oneself&nbsp;
and an appropriate way of life are necessary.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.840
I contributed to the doctrine of congenial work.&nbsp;
Although it is not metaphysically plausible,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.040
it expresses my faith in the creative&nbsp;
potential of human beings and the possibility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.520
of self-fulfillment in this life for everyone. My&nbsp;
poetic style, ideas, and moral example have played&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.920
an important role in the rebirth of Ukrainian&nbsp;
culture in the 20th century. Numerous great poets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.920
such as Mykola Filiansky, and Pavlo Tychyna have&nbsp;
found inspiration in me. The fullest editions of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.500
my works were published in many places across&nbsp;
the globe. My collected works in two volumes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.460
were published in Ukrainian translation in Kyiv.
I died in 1794 in a village called Ivanovka. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.360
lived trying to make the world a happier&nbsp;
place, connecting souls before nations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.640
hearts before hands. I hope my contribution&nbsp;
to the world is still blooming to this day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.320
with many fruits and colors. The world&nbsp;
tried to capture me but didn't succeed.
