00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:09.680
I am Jomo Kenyatta. Born in 1897 in&nbsp;
Kiambu. I am an anti-colonial activist and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.160
politician who governed Kenya as its Prime&nbsp;
Minister and then as its first President.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.400
I am still often referred to as&nbsp;
mzee or the Father of the Nation.
 &nbsp;

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.320
My parents died while I was young, and I then&nbsp;
moved to Muthiga to live with my grandfather.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:32.400
I left for Nairobi in 1922 to become a government&nbsp;
clerk. I also became more involved with the Kikuyu&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.720
Central Association or the K.C.A in 1925 and&nbsp;
resigned from my government post that same year.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.160
In 1928 I became secretary-general of the K.C.A&nbsp;
and editor of its vernacular Kikuyu newspaper.
 &nbsp;

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.480
Appointed as an emissary to England by the&nbsp;
K.C.A, I made presentations to the Colonial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.680
Office in England in 1929 and 1930. While in&nbsp;
Europe, I studied anthropology at the London&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.040
School of Economics, gave public lectures,&nbsp;
wrote to newspapers, participated in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.320
Pan-African Congress, and wrote a book on the&nbsp;
Kikuyu people entitled Facing Mount Kenya. 
 &nbsp;

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:19.200
On my return to Kenya in 1946, I became president&nbsp;
of the Kenya African Union (K.A.U). Shortly I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.280
arrested with 97 other K.A.U leaders for claims&nbsp;
over the murder of Chief Waruhiu Kungu and for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.000
managing the Mau Mau Rebellion. After 15 years,&nbsp;
I was released after national and international&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.440
protests. I then joined the Kenya African National&nbsp;
Union and soon became its president. Our party won&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.920
most seats in the new national assembly and&nbsp;
the following year I was named president.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.840
I urged reconciliation among the various Kenyan&nbsp;
political factions and devised the national&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.160
slogan, Harambbee which means “pull-together”.
 
I established agencies that offered assistance to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.760
indigenous Kenyans, granted former settler&nbsp;
farms to squatters and ex-Mau Mau members,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.960
abolished British colonial laws which allowed&nbsp;
racial discrimination and promoted educational&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.440
reforms. My presidency is widely respected today&nbsp;
for its many accomplishments and for its stability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:21.120
and peace. I died in Mombasa in 1978. Our&nbsp;
children may learn about the heroes of the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.553
Our task is to make ourselves&nbsp;
the architects of the future.
