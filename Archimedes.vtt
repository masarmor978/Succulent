00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:10.640
I am Archimedes. Born in 287 BC in Syracuse
on the eastern coast of Sicily, Italy. I was

2
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.470
a Greek mathematician, philosopher and inventor
who wrote important works on geometry, arithmetic

3
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.249
and mechanics.
I was educated in Alexandria in Egypt. I then

4
00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:26.859
returned to Syracuse, where I spent most of
the rest of my life, devoting my time to research

5
00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.780
and experimentation in many fields. In mechanics
I defined the principle of the lever and is

6
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.149
credited with inventing the compound pulley
and the hydraulic screw for raising water

7
00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.850
from a lower to higher level. I am also credited
with discovering a very accurate estimate

8
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.250
for the value of pi in advanced mathematics.
I was also recognized as a weapons designer,

9
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.760
engineer, inventor, astronomer, physicist,
and all-round scientist.

10
00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.370
I am most famous for discovering the law of
hydrostatics, sometimes known as 'Archimedes'

11
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.089
principle', stating that a body immersed in
fluid loses weight equal to the weight of

12
00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.430
the amount of fluid it displaces. I am supposed
to have made this discovery when stepping

13
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.560
into my bath, causing me to exclaim 'Eureka!'

14
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.700
During the Roman conquest of Sicily in 214
BC, I worked for the state, and several of

15
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.260
my mechanical devices were employed in the
defense of Syracuse. Among the war machines

16
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.680
attributed to me are the catapult and - perhaps
legendary - a mirror system for focusing the

17
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.140
sun's rays on the invaders' boats and igniting
them. After Syracuse was captured, I was killed

18
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.800
by a Roman soldier. I was so absorbed in my
calculations that I told my killer not to

19
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.810
disturb me.
if you Give me but a firm spot on which to

20
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.120
stand, then I shall move the world. I tried
to make better present and future with my

21
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.490
studies and research. I hope people still
believe in science and its abilities to make

22
00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.612
our lives better.
