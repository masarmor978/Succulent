00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.360
I am Vincent Van Gogh, born in 1853 in Zundert
in the southern Netherlands. I am one of the

2
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.900
most well-known post-Impressionist painters,
although I was not widely appreciated in my

3
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.260
lifetime.
In 1869, I took my first job, working in the

4
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.580
Hague branch of an international art dealing
firm. I began to write to my younger brother

5
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.390
Theo, a correspondence which continued for
the rest of my life.

6
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.789
My job took me to London and Paris, but I
was not interested in the work and was dismissed

7
00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:38.800
in 1876. I briefly became a teacher in England,
and then, deeply interested in Christianity,

8
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.940
I become a preacher in a mining community
in southern Belgium.

9
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.059
In 1880, at the age of 27, I decided to become
an artist. I moved around, teaching myself

10
00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.580
to draw and paint and receiving financial
support from Theo. In 1886, I joined Theo

11
00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.450
in Paris, and met many artists including Degas,
Lautrec, Pissarro, and Gauguin, with whom

12
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.960
I became friends. My style changed significantly
under the influence of Impressionism, becoming

13
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.720
lighter and brighter. I painted many self-portraits
in this period.

14
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.960
In 1888, I moved to Provence in southern France,
where I painted my famous series 'Sunflowers'.

15
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.570
I invited Gauguin to join me, but we soon
began to quarrel and one night, I threatened

16
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.719
Gauguin with a razor. Deeply remorseful, I
then cut off part of my own ear.

17
00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.340
This was the first serious sign of the mental
health problems that were to afflict me for

18
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.710
the rest of my life. I spent time in psychiatric
hospitals and swung between periods of inertia,

19
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.549
depression and incredibly concentrated artistic
activity, my work reflecting the intense colors

20
00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.380
and strong light of the countryside around
me.

21
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.200
In 1890, again suffering from depression,
I shot myself and died two days later. Normality

22
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.770
is a paved road: It is comfortable to walk,
but no flowers grow on it. In my life I created

23
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.749
many roads and I wish it led many big hearts
to new worlds.
