00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:09.040
I am José Gervasio Artigas, I 
was born in 1764 in Montevideo,  

2
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.040
current day Uruguay. My significance crossed 
national boundaries as I am considered architect  

3
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.160
of a feeling of uniqueness and regional pride 
that eventually led to independence in Uruguay. 

4
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.840
In 1810, I was attracted to a patriotic cause 
and from 1810 to 1811 I commanded Uruguayan  

5
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.320
patriots in the war of independence against the 
Spanish. I conquered almost all of Uruguay except  

6
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.320
for the city of Montevideo. Then I became the 
spokesman for those who wanted more autonomy for  

7
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.600
the provinces that wanted to form the Viceroyalty 
of the silver River Plate which contains most of  

8
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.840
current day south American southern countries.
By that time, Buenos Aires favored little  

9
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.680
provincial autonomy and a strong central 
government located in Buenos Aires. As this  

10
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.680
contradicts with my followers’ beliefs, a civil 
war between my forces and Buenos Aires began.  

11
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.080
Both forces were well matched. I had the support 
of the region that would become Uruguay and also  

12
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.680
the support of four river provinces that made up 
the Liga Federal, a confederation of provinces.  

13
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.720
Buenos Aires, in addition to the 
population of the province and city,  

14
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.000
had the revenue of the port facilities and 
the allegiance of some interior provinces. 

15
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.600
I participated in the successful siege of 
Montevideo, which the Spanish still held, and  

16
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:39.760
in 1815 entered Buenos Aires in triumph. But in 
1816 I faced ultimate defeat when the Portuguese,  

17
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.880
hoping to add the liberated regions to Brazil, 
invaded Uruguay. After a 4-year struggle my forces  

18
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.640
were defeated. I later lived in exile in Paraguay.
1828 was the year of Uruguayan independence. I was  

19
00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.080
invited to return by my victorious followers, 
but I declined as I never favored independence  

20
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.600
for Uruguay, always preferring the concept of 
a confederation of all provinces making up the  

21
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.240
former viceroyalty of the silver River Plate.
I died in 1850 wishing people of my region to  

22
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.000
live in prosperity and benefit from 
the blessings we have in our land.  

23
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.840
I hope this desire lives to this day and 
societies are flourishing on our fertile lands.
