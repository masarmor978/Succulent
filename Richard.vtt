00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.040
I am Richard I, the 'Lion 
Heart', born in 1157 in Oxford.  

2
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.520
I am famous for my exploits in the Third Crusade. 
I am the son of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine.  

3
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.880
I possessed considerable political and 
military ability. However, like my brothers,  

4
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.760
I fought with my family, joining them in the 
great rebellion against our father in 1173. 

5
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.200
In 1183 my brother Henry died, leaving me heir to 
the throne. My father wanted to give Aquitaine to  

6
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.920
my brother, John. I refused and, in 1189, joined 
forces with Philip II of France against my father,  

7
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.160
hounding him to a premature death in July 1189.
My chief ambition as a king was to join the Third  

8
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.000
Crusade, prompted by Saladin's capture 
of Jerusalem in 1187. To finance this,  

9
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.840
I sold sheriffdoms and other offices and in 
1190 I departed for the Holy Land. In May,  

10
00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.120
I reached Cyprus and later arrived in the Holy 
Land in 1191 and Acre fell the following month.  

11
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.920
I achieved another victory at Arsuf which 
gave the crusaders possession of Joppa.  

12
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.320
Although I came close, Jerusalem, the 
crusade's main objective, eluded me. Moreover,  

13
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.720
fierce quarrels among the French, German and 
English contingents provided further troubles.  

14
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.840
After a year's stalemate, I made a truce 
with Saladin and started my journey home. 

15
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.520
Bad weather drove me ashore near Venice and I was 
imprisoned by Duke Leopold of Austria before being  

16
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.520
handed over to the German emperor Henry VI, who 
ransomed me for the huge sum of 150,000 marks.  

17
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.440
The raising of the ransom was a remarkable 
achievement. In 1194, I was released and  

18
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.920
returned at once to England and was crowned for 
a second time, fearing that the ransom payment  

19
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.360
had compromised my independence. Yet a month 
later I went to Normandy, never to return.  

20
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.520
My last five years were spent in intermittent 
warfare against Philip II. While besieging the  

21
00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.000
castle of Chalus in central France I was fatally 
wounded and died on 1199. We place the love of God  

22
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.840
and His honor above our own. That was my life 
and I hope it yielded fruitful for my people.
