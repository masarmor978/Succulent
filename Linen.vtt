1
00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:08.870
I am Vladimir Ilich Ulyanov, also known as
Lenin. I was born in Simbirsk on the Volga

2
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.250
River in current day Russia in 1870. I am
known as one of the leading political figures

3
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.100
and revolutionary thinkers of the 20th century.
I masterminded the Bolshevik take-over of

4
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.060
power in Russia in 1917 and was the architect
and first head of the USS.

5
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.949
I am from a well-educated family. I excelled
at school and went on to study law. At university,

6
00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:39.079
I was exposed to radical thinking, and my
views were also influenced by the execution

7
00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.440
of my elder brother, a member of a revolutionary
group.

8
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.739
Expelled from university for my radical policies,
I completed my law degree as an external student

9
00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.170
in 1891. I moved to St Petersburg and became
a professional revolutionary. Like many of

10
00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:03.329
my contemporaries, I was arrested and exiled
to Siberia. After my Siberian exile, I adopted

11
00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.570
Lenin as pseudonym in 1901 and spent most
of the subsequent decade and a half in western

12
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.600
Europe, where I emerged as a prominent figure
in the international revolutionary movement

13
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.200
and became the leader of the 'Bolshevik' faction
of the Russian Social Democratic Worker's

14
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.549
Party.
In 1917, exhausted by World War One, Russia

15
00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.390
was ripe for change. Assisted by the Germans,
I returned home and started working against

16
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.880
the provisional government that had overthrown
the tsarist regime. I eventually led what

17
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.499
was soon to be known as the October Revolution.
Almost three years of civil war followed.

18
00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:45.829
The Bolsheviks were victorious and assumed
total control of the country.

19
00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.299
During this period of revolution, war, and
famine, I demonstrated pragmatic and firm

20
00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.140
leadership of the nation. I introduced the
New Economic Policy, where a measure of private

21
00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.859
enterprise was permitted. In 1918, I narrowly
survived an assassination attempt, but was

22
00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:10.410
severely wounded. I died in 1924 and my body
was embalmed and placed in a mausoleum on

23
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.500
Moscow's Red Square. Sometimes - history needs
a push. I hope my reforms have taken my beloved

24
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.569
nation to the top of civilizations.
