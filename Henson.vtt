I am Matthew Henson, an African American explorer&nbsp;
born in 1866 in Maryland, The United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.560
I am best known as the co-discoverer of the&nbsp;
North Pole with Robert Edwin Peary in 1909.
 &nbsp;

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.320
My parents were freeborn Black sharecroppers.&nbsp;
At the age of 11, I lost both and found work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.080
as a cabin boy on the ship Katie Hines. During&nbsp;
my time aboard the Katie Hines, I also saw much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.040
of the world, traveling to various African&nbsp;
countries, China, Japan, and even Russia. 
 &nbsp;

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.800
I was eventually recruited by the explorer, Robert&nbsp;
C. Peary, to accompany him on an expedition to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.760
Nicaragua. We would go on to forge a twenty-year&nbsp;
partnership, with a mission to reach the North&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.640
Pole. After spending years in the arctic&nbsp;
preparing to reach the geographic North Pole,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.200
I became fluent in the Inuit language and&nbsp;
traded often with their people. I was also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.360
taught the art of Inuit dogsled driving and am&nbsp;
known as the only non-Inuit to have mastered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.880
dog training and sledding in this fashion.
 
In 1908, I and Peary left Greenland accompanied&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.440
by a group of Inuit men, women, and children for&nbsp;
our eighth attempt at reaching the North Pole.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.560
Peary was sick and exhausted, and I went ahead of&nbsp;
him to lead the way and made it to the North Pole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.840
before anyone else in the group. Upon returning to&nbsp;
the U.S., Peary was given all the credit for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.560
mission, and I was largely forgotten about. 
 
I went on to write my autobiography,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.440
A Negro Explorer at the North Pole, and I spent&nbsp;
thirty years working for the U.S. Customs House&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.400
in New York, at the request of Teddy Roosevelt.&nbsp;
I received the Congressional medal awarded to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.960
all members of the Peary expedition in 1944.
 
I died in New York City in 1955 after joining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.640
8 expeditions to the arctic. I think I am the&nbsp;
first man to sit on top of the world. A world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.252
that has many unseen corners and it’s in our hands&nbsp;
to pave the way to reach them. Let’s explore!
