00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.760
I am Ivan Poddubny. Born in 1871&nbsp;
in Poltava Governorate, Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.720
I am a professional wrestler from the Russian&nbsp;
Empire and later the Soviet Union. I began my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.160
sports career around 1900 and lasted for about&nbsp;
forty years and I have never lost a fair fight.&nbsp;

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.280
I am from a Zaporozhian Cossacks family. Our&nbsp;
family was big and it was a difficult time to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.160
provide for us, therefore I was forced to&nbsp;
leave my father's house before turning 20.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.880
I worked as a fitter in the ports of Sevastopol&nbsp;
and Feodosiya for seven years earning the nickname&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.800
of Ivan the Great. In 1903, I joined the Saint&nbsp;
Petersburg Athletic Club with which I participated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.720
in World Championships in Moscow and Paris. In&nbsp;
1905 I became the World Champion in wrestling in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.720
Paris and later toured Italy, Algeria, Belgium,&nbsp;
and Berlin, winning a championship in Nice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.000
In 1906, I won two more World Cups&nbsp;
in Paris, Frankfurt, Vienna and Milan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.680
before returning to my home in Krasenivka in 1910.
I did not waste his money earned during fights and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.720
upon my return home bought 490 acres of land, two&nbsp;
houses, a small store, a churn shop, and mills.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.240
In the 1920s, I was touring the United States&nbsp;
staying undefeated while visiting New York City,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.640
Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, and San&nbsp;
Francisco. At age 56 I won a beauty contest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.520
among men in the United States. Being unable to&nbsp;
take out my earned half a million dollars from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.880
the bank as it required to be a citizen, I left&nbsp;
for home. Later I continued to perform in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.320
Russian circuses retiring finally at age of 70.
The last farewell performance I did was in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.240
Tula city circus in 1941. After my retirement,&nbsp;
I with my wife settled in our two-story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.400
house with a garden in Kuban, Russia.
I maintained a lifelong professional&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.240
rivalry with wrestler Stanislaus Zbyszko. I&nbsp;
died undefeated 1949, from a heart attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.514
I used my strength to make the world a better&nbsp;
place. I hope this is how we all use our powers.
