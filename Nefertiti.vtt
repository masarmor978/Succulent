00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:11.010
I am Nefertiti, also known as Neferneferuaten,
born in 1370 BCE in the middle east. the queen

2
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.039
of Egypt and wife of King Akhenaton, who played
a prominent role in the cult of the sun goddess

3
00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.030
known as the Aton.
I bore six daughters within 10 years of my

4
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.070
marriage with King Akhenaton, the elder three
being born at Thebes, the younger three at

5
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.249
Amarna in Egypt. Two of my daughters became
queens of Egypt. I served my husband and played

6
00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:37.420
a more prominent role, usurping kingly privileges
to serve as a priest and offer to the Aton.

7
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.710
I also participated in the ritual smiting
of the female enemies of Egypt. I wore my

8
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.359
own unique headdress—a tall, straight-edged,
flat-topped blue crown in those rituals.

9
00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:53.960
When Aton became Egypt’s dominant national
divinity, I continued to play an important

10
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.090
religious role, worshipping alongside my husband
and serving as the female element in the divine

11
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.110
triad formed by Aton, the king Akhenaton,
and myself. I and the royal family appeared

12
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.340
on private devotional stelae and on the walls
of nonroyal tombs, and images of myself stood

13
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.940
at the four corners of my husband’s sarcophagus.
After my husband death in his 12th regnal

14
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.220
year, one of the princesses died, three disappeared
and are also presumed to have died. I also

15
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.740
vanished from historical records until 1912,
when a German archaeological mission discovered

16
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.170
a portrait bust of me lying in the ruins of
the Amarna workshop of the sculptor Thutmose.

17
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.600
The bust went on display at a museum in Berlin
in the 1920s and immediately attracted worldwide

18
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.700
attention, causing me to become one of the
most recognizable and, despite a missing left

19
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.020
eye, most beautiful female figures from the
ancient world.

20
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.610
My name translates to “A Beautiful Woman
Has Come”. That’s how my king saw me and

21
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.110
so I dedicated my life for him and for my
belief to form the wealthiest period of ancient

22
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.510
Egyptian history. I hope our kingdom is lasting
to this day and still considered a land of

23
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.170
kings, love, peace and wealth.
