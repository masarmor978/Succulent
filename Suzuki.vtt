00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.220
I am Miekichi Suzuki born in Hiroshima in
1882. I am a novelist and an author for many

2
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:16.000
children books. I am a literary person and
considered the Father of Japanese Children’s

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.760
Literature.
In my teenage times I showed distinguishable

4
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.239
writing skills. When I was “15” years
old, I published my first works under the

5
00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:31.409
name “The Emperor's Birthday” and "Longing
for My Late Mother". The later work has strong

6
00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:37.930
relation with my mother who passed away when
I was 11 years old. In “1901” I entered

7
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.910
Tokyo university to study English Literature.
Later I taught English in many high schools

8
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.090
and universities across japan earning the
respect of my workers and supervisors.

9
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.400
Some of my major works includes: “The Plover”
and “The Mulberry” that are milestones

10
00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.860
in the Japanese literature of that time. In
“1918”, I had my first daughter, Suzu.

11
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.040
At the same year I launched the children’s
literature magazine that’s called, Akai

12
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.499
Tori or The Red Bird, which gave birth to
the first songs and fairy tales for children

13
00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:18.280
in Japan. I guided Japanese teachers on how
to write composition and free verse in order

14
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.979
to develop children’s creativity and also
introduced classic children’s stories from

15
00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.060
overseas. Akai Tori become a famous magazine
and many sharp writers contributed to it through

16
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.630
masterpieces such as The Spider's Thread and
A Bunch of Grapes beside other children’s

17
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.249
songs and plays.
In “1935” I suffered from asthma but I

18
00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:45.789
continued my passion in contributing to the
Japanese children literature. In “1936”

19
00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.639
my health condition worsened and I passed
away that year at the age of 53 from lung

20
00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:56.439
cancer. The Akai Tori continued to be published
for 18 years after my death which continued

21
00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.740
to have great impact on the educational world,
where the movement for education that respected

22
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.749
children was growing.
In “1948”, the Miekichi Suzuki Award was

23
00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:13.760
established. It awarded outstanding essays
and poems by children throughout Japan. I

24
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.920
hope my work has influenced children creativity
and helped creating generations that contribute

25
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.420
to inspire Japan and the world. I will forever
dream, simply as I did in my boyhood, and

26
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.019
therefore suffer only a little.
