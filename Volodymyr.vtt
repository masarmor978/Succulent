00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.520
I am Vladimir the Great, born&nbsp;
in 956, Kyiv, Kievan Rus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.280
the current day Ukraine. I am the grand prince of&nbsp;
Kyiv and the first Christian ruler in Kievan Rus.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.360
My military conquests consolidated the provinces&nbsp;
of Kyiv and Novgorod into a single state and paved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.880
the way to spread Christianity in the region.
I am the son of the Norman-Rus prince Svyatoslav&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.840
of Kyiv. My ruling path started by&nbsp;
being the prince of Novgorod in 970.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.080
In two years, my father passed away forcing me to&nbsp;
flee to Scandinavia, where I enlisted help from my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.960
uncle and overcame my half-brother Yaropolk, who&nbsp;
attempted to seize the duchy of Novgorod as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.640
as Kyiv. By 980 I had consolidated the Kievan&nbsp;
realm from Ukraine to the Baltic Sea and had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.200
solidified the frontiers against incursions&nbsp;
of Bulgarian, Baltic, and Eastern nomads.&nbsp;

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.320
Although Christianity in Kyiv existed&nbsp;
before my rule, I had remained a pagan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.320
accumulated about seven wives, and established&nbsp;
temples. With insurrections troubling Byzantium,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.680
the emperor Basil II sought military aid from my&nbsp;
kingdom, which was granted in exchange for Basil’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.400
sister Anne in marriage. A pact was reached about&nbsp;
987, when I also consented to the condition that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.160
become a Christian. Having undergone baptism,&nbsp;
I stormed the Byzantine area of Chersonesus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.080
current day Sevastopol, to eliminate&nbsp;
Constantinople’s final reluctance.&nbsp;

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.280
I then ordered the Christian conversion of Kyiv&nbsp;
and Novgorod, where idols were cast into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.800
Dnieper River after local resistance had been&nbsp;
suppressed. The Rus-Byzantine religiopolitical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.640
integration checked the influence of the&nbsp;
Roman Latin church in the Slavic East and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.280
determined the course of Russian Christianity,&nbsp;
although Kyiv exchanged legates with the papacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.400
Among the churches erected by me was the&nbsp;
Desiatynna in Kyiv which became the symbol of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.160
the Rus conversion. I also expanded education,&nbsp;
judicial institutions, and aid to the poor.&nbsp;

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.440
In 1011, I affiliated myself with the Holy&nbsp;
Roman emperors of the German Ottonian.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.400
I spend my life protecting my people and our&nbsp;
rights to live with pride and prosperity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.840
I hope my efforts are yielding&nbsp;
fruitfully to this day.
