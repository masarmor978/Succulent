00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:10.960
I am Kusunoki Masashige born 1294 , Minato gawa,&nbsp;
Settsu province, current day Hyogo Prefecture).&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.920
I am one of the greatest military strategists in&nbsp;
Japanese history. I also served as governor of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.920
central Japanese provinces of Settsu, Kawachi,&nbsp;
and Izumi and was a major figure in the central&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.800
government. In 1331, I joined the emperor Go-Daigo&nbsp;
in a revolt to wrest the power of government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.960
from the shogunate, the hereditary military&nbsp;
dictatorship that had dominated Japan since 1192.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.640
Although the numerically stronger shogunate&nbsp;
troops captured the emperor, I continued the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.240
war using guerrilla tactics and later captured of&nbsp;
the fortress of Chihaya near Nara in central Japan&nbsp;

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.640
This proved a major threat to the central&nbsp;
government. The worried shogun then concentrated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.920
all his forces against the rebel forces, to the&nbsp;
detriment of other parts of the country, where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.320
some warriors joined the rebel forces. In one&nbsp;
of the most famous battles in Japanese history,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.840
I successfully defended the fortress of Chihaya&nbsp;
against the vastly superior shogunal forces.&nbsp;

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.960
In the year 1333, the shogun’s capital at&nbsp;
Kamakura was captured by Nitta Yoshisada,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.640
thus ending the rule of the Hojo family, who&nbsp;
controlled the shogunate. The real power in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.880
the countryside, however, continued to be held&nbsp;
by the great hereditary lords, chiefly Ashikaga&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.040
Takauji who openly vied to gain the loyalty of the&nbsp;
minor feudal chieftains against Nitta Yoshisada.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.320
In 1335, emperor Go-Daigo sided with&nbsp;
Nitta Yoshisada against Ashikaga Takauji.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.760
As head of the imperial forces, I defeated&nbsp;
Takauji’s troops in January 1336 and forced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.920
him to flee the capital. A few months later,&nbsp;
however, Takauji returned at the head of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.760
large combined army and navy. I suggested that&nbsp;
we temporarily retreat so that we could fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.600
Takauji’s forces at a point where the terrain&nbsp;
was more favorable. The emperor insisted that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.240
I advance and meet the much larger enemy&nbsp;
forces before they occupied the capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.400
In the final battle at the Minato River,&nbsp;
near modern Kobe, I fought for many hours,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.520
but my troops were finally overwhelmed, and&nbsp;
I committed suicide rather than face capture.&nbsp;

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.880
I fought to protect the values of&nbsp;
loyalty, unity, honesty and devotion,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.840
I am sure those are still until today&nbsp;
the ruling vines of the Japanese society.
