00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:17.980
I am Kusunoki Masashige born 1294 , Minato
gawa, Settsu province, current day Hyogo Prefecture).

2
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.349
I am one of the greatest military strategists
in Japanese history.

3
00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:28.329
I also served as governor of the central Japanese
provinces of Settsu, Kawachi, and Izumi and

4
00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.649
was a major figure in the central government.

5
00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:37.050
In 1331, I joined the emperor Go-Daigo in
a revolt to wrest the power of government

6
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.969
from the shogunate, the hereditary military
dictatorship that had dominated Japan since

7
00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.579
1192.

8
00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.949
Although the numerically stronger shogunate
troops captured the emperor, I continued the

9
00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.870
war using guerrilla tactics and later captured
of the fortress of Chihaya near Nara in central

10
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.109
Japan
This proved a major threat to the central

11
00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:58.219
government.

12
00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.289
The worried shogun then concentrated all his
forces against the rebel forces, to the detriment

13
00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.190
of other parts of the country, where some
warriors joined the rebel forces.

14
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.040
In one of the most famous battles in Japanese
history, I successfully defended the fortress

15
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.080
of Chihaya against the vastly superior shogunal
forces.

16
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.690
In the year 1333, the shogun’s capital at
Kamakura was captured by Nitta Yoshisada,

17
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.110
thus ending the rule of the Hojo family, who
controlled the shogunate.

18
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.660
The real power in the countryside, however,
continued to be held by the great hereditary

19
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.020
lords, chiefly Ashikaga Takauji who openly
vied to gain the loyalty of the minor feudal

20
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.730
chieftains against Nitta Yoshisada.

21
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:49.240
In 1335, emperor Go-Daigo sided with Nitta
Yoshisada against Ashikaga Takauji.

22
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.050
As head of the imperial forces, I defeated
Takauji’s troops in January 1336 and forced

23
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.580
him to flee the capital.

24
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.110
A few months later, however, Takauji returned
at the head of a large combined army and navy.

25
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.820
I suggested that we temporarily retreat so
that we could fight Takauji’s forces at

26
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.800
a point where the terrain was more favorable.

27
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.980
The emperor insisted that I advance and meet
the much larger enemy forces before they occupied

28
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.450
the capital.

29
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.889
In the final battle at the Minato River, near
modern Kobe, I fought for many hours, but

30
00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:28.200
my troops were finally overwhelmed, and I
committed suicide rather than face capture.

31
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.769
I fought to protect the values of loyalty,
unity, honesty and devotion, I am sure those

32
00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.510
are still until today the ruling vines of
the Japanese society.
