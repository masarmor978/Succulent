00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:16.280
I am Saigo Takamori, hailed from Satsuma (modern-day
Kagoshima) in 1828.

2
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.470
My family was of modest means but deeply proud
of their samurai lineage.

3
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:27.580
I grew into an imposing figure, standing six
feet tall and weighing about 200 pounds.

4
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.780
Beside being a skilled warrior, I was also
dedicated to the ideas of neo-Confucianism

5
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.190
and Buddhism.

6
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.230
During my life, Japan encountered the Meiji
Restoration which meant the end of the samurai

7
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.300
life style yet some people favored the originality
rather than modernization.

8
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.560
Because of that, I was exiled by my new lord
twice.

9
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.489
This made me reconsider many aspects in the
Japanese newly formed society.

10
00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.990
I returned to Satsuma to play a leading role
in the political and military struggles of

11
00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.990
the mid-19th century.

12
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:08.240
In 1868, my troops occupied Edo – current
day Tokyo, defeating the shogunate forces.

13
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.260
In 1871, I returned to Tokyo as the head of
the newly formed Imperial Guard.

14
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.810
I found many Japanese values being replaced
with western ones.

15
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.540
Despising the craze for Western fashion, I
continued to wear the traditional dress of

16
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.479
my region, shod in sandals or clogs.

17
00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.990
I understood that Japan’s modernization
was inevitable, even desirable, but I could

18
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.700
not betray those who had fought under me.

19
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.869
I returned to Satsuma where I set up a military
academy.

20
00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.030
Many young samurai were attracted to my school.

21
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.860
By 1877 I had an estimated 20,000 students.

22
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.890
When the government tried to confiscate weapons
from Satsuma’s arsenal in 1877, the samurai

23
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.070
took up arms and rebelled.

24
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.930
We sought refuge on Mount Shiroyama.

25
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.399
I informed my troops that this would be our
final battle and enjoined them to die bravely.

26
00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.160
I was dressed in an austere yellow kimono,
saber in hand.

27
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.130
I charged down the hillside with a few last
fighters.

28
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.130
I was wounded by a bullet in my right thigh,
felled by the modern army i had helped create.

29
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.260
The extent of the defeat suffered by the samurai
cause was almost total.

30
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.790
I hope my dignity and courage in facing the
classic Japanese conflict between the quality

31
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.250
of duty and human instinct has made my country
one of the greatest countries in the world.
