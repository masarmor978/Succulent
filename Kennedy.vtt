00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.880
I am John Fitzgerald Kennedy, also&nbsp;
known as J.F Kennedy. born in 1917,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.080
Brookline, Massachusetts, America. I am&nbsp;
the 35th president of the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.120
I faced several foreign crises, especially&nbsp;
in Cuba and Berlin, but managed to secure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.960
achievements such as the Nuclear-Test-Ban&nbsp;
Treaty and the Alliance for Progress.&nbsp;

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.160
I grew up in a powerful political family which&nbsp;
allowed us to enroll in the best schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.520
I graduated from Harvard with honors. I then&nbsp;
traveled to Great Britain to be with my father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.960
who was the U.S Ambassador to Great Britain at&nbsp;
the time. Here I learned firsthand about World&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.320
War II. I joined the navy and was in command&nbsp;
of a patrol torpedo boat when it was sunk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.920
I rescued our boat crew which made me a war hero.
I became involved in politics which paved my way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.280
to Congress to become a congressman and U.S&nbsp;
Senator. Besides politics, I published the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.640
Profiles in Courage book which was awarded the&nbsp;
Pulitzer Prize in history. I ran for president&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.640
in 1960 against Richard Nixon and won in one of&nbsp;
the closest elections in history. My presidency&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.600
was marked by major events in the Cold War such&nbsp;
as the Berlin Wall in Germany by the communists,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.200
the Bay of Pigs, and the Cuban Missile Crisis.&nbsp;
Just a few months after becoming president,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.320
I decided to try and help Cuban rebels overthrow&nbsp;
the communist Cuban leader, Fidel Castro.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.600
The invasion failed miserably when the&nbsp;
CIA-assisted rebels were soundly defeated.&nbsp;

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.400
In Cuba, the Soviet Union was building&nbsp;
missile bases with abilities to strike&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.880
the U.S with nuclear bombs. The world was never&nbsp;
closer to a nuclear war. After negotiations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.720
the Soviet Union agreed to dismantle the bases.&nbsp;
Consequently, the U.S agreed to never attack Cuba&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.600
and to remove missiles from Turkey.
In 1963 I was assassinated while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.800
riding in a convertible car in Texas. I&nbsp;
commanded fascination as a compelling,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.880
charismatic leader during a period of immense&nbsp;
challenge to the American body politic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.840
"Ask not what your country can do for you&nbsp;
- ask what you can do for your country"
