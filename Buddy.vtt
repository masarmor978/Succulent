I am Charles Hardin Holley, also known as&nbsp;
Buddy Holly. born in 1936, Lubbock, Texas,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.640
The United States. I am an American singer&nbsp;
and songwriter who produced some of the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.960
distinctive and influential works in rock music.
I came from a devout Baptists family in the West&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.200
Texas town of Lubbock, and gospel music was an&nbsp;
important part of my life from an early age. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.200
became seriously interested in music at about age&nbsp;
12 and pursued it with remarkable natural ability.&nbsp;

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.200
The African American rhythm and blues that I&nbsp;
heard on the radio had a tremendous impact on me.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.520
In 1956, I signed with Decca Records’ Nashville,&nbsp;
but the records we made sold poorly. That didn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.600
break me and in 1957, I formed a new group called&nbsp;
the Crickets which began my association with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.720
independent producer, Norman Petty at his studio&nbsp;
in New Mexico. This was when the magic began.&nbsp;

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.920
We created a series of recordings that displayed&nbsp;
an emotional intimacy and sense of detail that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.720
set us apart from other 1950s rock and roll.&nbsp;
Our recordings sounded classy, expensive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.240
and featured unusual microphone placement&nbsp;
techniques, and imaginative echo chamber effects,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.120
a process that in the 1950s meant superimposing&nbsp;
one recording on another. Our first single,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.920
“That’ll Be the Day”, was released in 1957.&nbsp;
We followed with more hits such as Peggy Sue,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.880
every day, and Rave On! They had an irrepressible&nbsp;
spirit, and by year’s end, our songs became&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.720
international multi-million-sellers. Due to&nbsp;
conflicts with Petty, I had to participate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.160
in the doomed “Winter Dance Party of&nbsp;
1959” tour through the frozen Midwest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.280
during which I and co-headliners Ritchie Valens&nbsp;
and the Big Bopper were killed in a plane crash.&nbsp;

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.880
Our innovative use of the studio and the fact&nbsp;
that we wrote most of our songs ourselves made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.080
us the single most important influence on&nbsp;
the Beatles. I was inducted into the Rock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.320
and Roll Hall of Fame and honored by the National&nbsp;
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. I hope my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:21.840
recordings are still an inspiration and convey&nbsp;
a sense of the wide-open spaces of our world.
