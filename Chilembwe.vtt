I am John Chilembwe, born in 1860,&nbsp;
Blantyre district, Nyasaland,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.680
Current day Malawi. I am a missionary&nbsp;
who led an abortive, largely symbolic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.440
uprising against British rule in 1915 and am seen&nbsp;
as a forerunner and martyr of Malawi nationalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.680
I was one of the first Africans to&nbsp;
speak of Nyasaland at a time when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.000
the vast majority of my fellow subjects&nbsp;
cared only for tribal identification.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.200
My first prolonged experience with Europeans was&nbsp;
from 1892 to 1895 as the servant and helper of an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.040
egalitarian fundamentalist missionary, Joseph&nbsp;
Booth. I was proud and independent-minded,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.480
but also eager to learn from whites and to&nbsp;
believe the best of them. In 1897 Booth took&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.720
me to the United States, where I received&nbsp;
a degree from a black theological college.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.120
When I returned to Nyasaland in 1900, I founded&nbsp;
my Providence Industrial Mission to educate and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.360
instill discipline and pride in the Nyasa&nbsp;
people of the district around Blantyre.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.640
My revolt is thought to have been rooted in my&nbsp;
growing disgust with the wanton cruelty of white&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.720
rule, especially on white estates that had African&nbsp;
tenants and wage earners. A more immediate cause&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.440
was the British use of Nyasa soldiers against&nbsp;
the Germans in East Africa at the outbreak of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.960
World War I. When no reply was forthcoming&nbsp;
to my written protest against conscription,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.960
I and a few followers decided on an admittedly&nbsp;
suicidal blow. We attacked a notoriously brutal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.360
estate, killing several managers and displaying&nbsp;
the severed head of one of them in a church.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.400
My instructions not to harm women and&nbsp;
children were strictly followed. Lacking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.440
support from other districts, the revolt quickly&nbsp;
collapsed, and I was shot by African police.&nbsp;

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.720
The revolt has been the subject of much research&nbsp;
and has been interpreted in various ways by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.960
historians. It marked a turning point in colonial&nbsp;
rule. My face is inserted on all banknotes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.400
in Malawi with respect to my sacrifice across&nbsp;
the nation. I gave my life to grant my people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.275
the right to live. I hope my spirit is living in&nbsp;
Malawianâ€™s hearts and inspires them to this day.
