00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.690
I am Ivan Kotliarevsky.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.250
Born in 1769 in Poltava, Ukraine.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.550
I am a Ukrainian writer, poet, and playwright,
social activist, regarded as the pioneer of

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.850
modern Ukrainian literature.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.480
I was a veteran of the Russo-Turkish War.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.990
My father was Ogonczyk Coat of Arms.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.680
I worked as a tutor for the gentry at rural
estates, where I became familiar with Ukrainian

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.300
folk life and the peasant vernacular.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.800
I served in the Imperial Russian Army and
participated in the Russo-Turkish War as a

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.770
staff captain during which the Russian troops
laid the siege to the city of Izmail.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.440
In 1812, during the French invasion of Imperial
Russia, I organized the 5th Ukrainian Cossack

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.489
Regiment in the town of Horoshyn and received
the rank of major.

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.010
One of my contributions to my Ukrainian nation
was in the field of literature.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.550
I helped stage theatrical productions at the
Poltava governor-general's residence and was

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.090
the artistic director of the Poltava Free
Theater.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.540
My Eneida poem is considered to be the first
literary work published wholly in the modern

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.520
Ukrainian language.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.820
Although Ukrainian was an everyday language
for millions of people in Ukraine, it was

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.590
officially discouraged from literary use in
the area controlled by Imperial Russia.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.270
Eneida is a parody of Virgil's Aeneid, where
I transformed the Trojan heroes into Zaporozhian

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.710
Cossacks.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.380
Critics believe that it was written in the
light of the destruction of the Zaporizhian

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.189
Host by the order of Catherine the Great.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.749
My two plays, also living classics, Natalka
from Poltava and Muscovite-Sorcerer, became

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:38.740
the impetus for the creation of the development
of Ukrainian national theater.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.329
I died in 1838, living my life defending my
people right to live with words and hands.

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.979
Where the love for the Motherland inspires
heroism, there an enemy force will not stand,

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.600
there a chest is stronger than cannons.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.109
I hope my people are standing strong to this
day, looking with pride at our past, with

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.020
passion towards our present, and with hope
towards our future.
