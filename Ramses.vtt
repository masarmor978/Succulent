00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.440
I am Ramses II, the pharaoh of Egypt's golden
age, I recognized that diplomacy and an exhaustive

2
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.090
public relations campaign could mitigate any
military shortcomings. My celebrated building

3
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.939
accomplishments, including the marvels at
Karnak and Abu Simbel, reflected my vision

4
00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.350
of a great nation. I have been regarded by
Egyptians as Ramses the Great and my 66-year

5
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.400
reign is considered to be the height of Egypt’s
power and glory.

6
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.230
My father and grandfather elevated our commoner
family to the ranks of royalty through military

7
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.579
prowess and securing the nation’s wealth
by opening mines and quarries and fortifying

8
00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.649
the northern frontier against the Hittites.
I ascended to the throne when I was 14 years

9
00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.289
old. Shortly after, the Hittites invaded Egyptian
land and took over the important trading town

10
00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.469
of Kadesh in modern-day Syria. I led my forces
to recapture Kadesh, but I was duped by spies

11
00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.410
into thinking the Hittites were far from the
Egyptian camp. We were on the brink of defeat

12
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.440
when reinforcements arrived just in the nick
of time. I won that battle but I did not win

13
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.770
the war.
After years of negotiation, I signed a peace

14
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.570
treaty with the Hittites. The first international
recorded peace treaty in written history.

15
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.840
A copy of the treaty was carved on a stela
in the temple of Karnak. A second copy, written

16
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.220
in Akkadian on a clay tablet, was discovered
in Turkey in 1906. The significance of this

17
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.580
peace treaty is reflected in the fact that
a replica of the tablet is on display at the

18
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.020
United Nations headquarters in New York.
My reign wealth is evident in my opulent building

19
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.440
campaign, the largest undertaken by any pharaoh.
My funerary temple, contained a massive library

20
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.920
of some 10000 papyrus scrolls. Many pharaohs
took my title, the great, solidifying my stature

21
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.000
among Egypt’s rulers. I died at the age
of 90 and was buried in a tomb in the Valley

22
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.390
of the Kings. I dedicated my life to forge
a powerful nation, a beacon of enlightenment

23
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.840
and glory that I am sure still stand with
pride and might until this day.
