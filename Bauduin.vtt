00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.800
I am Antonius Bauduin from the Netherlands.
I was born in “1820” in Dordrecht to a

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.780
French family. I studied medicine at the Utrecht
Army Military Medical School and the Utrecht

3
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.760
University School of Medicine, joined the
Dutch Army after graduation. In “1862”,

4
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.529
I came to Japan at the invitation of the Edo
Shogunate with the help of my younger brother

5
00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.100
who served as Dutch Consul in Japan. I later
became the vice-principal of Nagasaki Nursery

6
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.230
School. Meanwhile, I spread knowledge of medicine
in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagasaki, and strives

7
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.300
to enhance basic science education at the
nursery school. Upon a request from the shogunate,

8
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.570
I built a school of medical and science.
My Activities helped popularizing Dutch medicine

9
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.150
in Japan through nursery and medical schools,
I also enhanced the Japanese education system

10
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.900
for physics and chemistry. I was particularly
good at ophthalmology and introduced the first

11
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.310
ophthalmoscope in Japan. In addition, the
prescriptions of the stomachic medicine that

12
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.860
I brought to Japan was transmitted to the
Japanese have undergone my own improvement.

13
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.429
All of them have been changed in shape and
ingredients afterwards due to quality improvement

14
00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:26.329
and drug price revision, but they are still
on the market until now.

15
00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:32.520
In addition to being a doctor, I was also
active as a photographer. In “2011”, art

16
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.399
historian Flip Bool found an anonymous nineteenth-century
office notebook in an antiquarian bookshop

17
00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:44.700
in Haarlem, which were probably taken by me.
Among the 56 cityscapes are the oldest known

18
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.030
shots of the garrison towns of Breda, Dalem,
Gorinchem, Leeuwarden, Venlo, Zierikzee and

19
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.009
Zutphen.
In “1870”, I worked at Osaka Temporary

20
00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.789
School and Osaka Army Hospital. I later came
back to the Netherlands in “1873” until

21
00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:10.259
my retirement in “1884” and died one year
later. The human life is the most valuable

22
00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.080
thing in existence and I hope my efforts have
contributed in make better lives in Japan

23
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.340
and all over the world
