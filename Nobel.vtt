00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.480
I am Alfred Nobel. born in 1833 in&nbsp;
Stockholm, Sweden. I am a chemist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.600
and the inventor of dynamite. During my&nbsp;
life, I registered 355 patents and was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.040
credited for establishing the Nobel Prize.
 
In 1842, my family moved to Russia where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.800
my father had opened an engineering firm&nbsp;
providing equipment for the Tsar's armies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.360
In 1850, my father sent me abroad to study&nbsp;
chemical engineering. During a two-year period,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:36.000
I visited Sweden, Germany, France, and the United&nbsp;
States. I returned to Sweden in 1863 with my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.200
father after our family firm went bankrupt.
 
Back in Sweden, I devoted myself to the study&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.640
of explosives. I was particularly interested in&nbsp;
the safe manufacture and use of nitroglycerin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.520
a highly unstable explosive. My brother, Emil, had&nbsp;
been killed in a nitroglycerin explosion in 1864.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.240
I incorporated this dangerous material&nbsp;
into silica, an inert substance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.400
which made it safer and easier to manipulate. This&nbsp;
I patented in 1867 under the name of 'dynamite'.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.000
Dynamite established my fame and was soon used&nbsp;
in blasting tunnels, cutting canals, and building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.200
railways and roads all over the world. 
 
In the 1870s and 1880s, I built up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.480
a network of factories all over&nbsp;
Europe to manufacture explosives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.400
In 1894, I bought an ironworks at Bofors in&nbsp;
Sweden that became the nucleus of the well-known&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.160
Bofors arms factory. I continued to work in my&nbsp;
laboratory, inventing several synthetic materials,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.160
and went on to invent several other explosives.
 
In 1895, I signed my will, providing for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.080
establishment of the Nobel Prizes. I set aside the&nbsp;
bulk of my huge fortune to establish annual prizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.960
in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology, Medicine,&nbsp;
Literature, and Peace. After my death in 1896,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.040
an economics Prize was added to the Nobel awards.
 
Nature is man's teacher. She unfolds her treasures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.880
to his search, unseals his eye, illumes his mind,&nbsp;
and purifies his heart; an influence breathes from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.920
all the sights and sounds of her existence. I&nbsp;
aim to improve people's lives through science,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.442
I hope my inventions are put to good use to&nbsp;
make the world a better place for us all.
