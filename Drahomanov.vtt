00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:09.760
I am Mykhailo Drahomanov, born in 1841 in Hadiach,&nbsp;
Ukraine. I am a Ukrainian political theorist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.760
economist, historian, philosopher, ethnographer,&nbsp;
and public figure in Kyiv. I am known as one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.280
of the first socialist activists in Ukraine.
I am from a noble family of Petro Drahomanov who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.320
was of Cossack descent, I started my education&nbsp;
at home, then studied at the Hadiach school,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.000
Poltava senior school, and the Taras Shevchenko&nbsp;
National University of Kyiv. My family is linked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.280
to many Ukrainian national figures such as the&nbsp;
Ukrainian poet Larysa Kosach and Olena Pchilka.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.840
Many of my family members were members of the&nbsp;
Decembrist movement and political prisoners.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.480
This sharpened my national views.
I lectured at Kyiv University between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.200
1870 and 1875, but because of the repressions&nbsp;
against the Ukrainian movement peaking up in 1876,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.000
I emigrated to Geneva. I continued my political,&nbsp;
scholarly, and publishing activities. In 1895,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.480
I wrote the first systematic political program for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.000
the Ukrainian national movement which&nbsp;
was described as ethical socialism.&nbsp;

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.920
I was one of the leaders of the Kyiv&nbsp;
administrative unit called the Hromada.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.040
This allowed me to be in contact with Ukrainians&nbsp;
of Austria and the Academic Circle in Lemberg&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.160
which yielded the establishment of&nbsp;
the Ukrainian democratic platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.240
As a result, in 1875 I was fired from&nbsp;
Kyiv University by the Russian government.&nbsp;

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.440
I became a spokesman for Hromada abroad while&nbsp;
settling in Geneva, Switzerland. I published&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.960
the Ukrainian political magazine and created the&nbsp;
Ukrainian socialist organization. my legacy can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.160
be discerned in the whole Ukrainian tradition of&nbsp;
leftist political parties and political activism.&nbsp;

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.800
I personally influenced a handful of younger&nbsp;
Ukrainian intellectuals in Habsburg Galicia in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.720
the late 1870s, such as Ivan Franko and Mykhailo&nbsp;
Pavlyk, both of whom accepted my ideas although&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.160
reworked them later according to their own&nbsp;
mold. I died in 1895 giving not only all my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.880
intellectual forces and health but also all my&nbsp;
familyâ€™s material resources for the national,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.000
political, and social liberation of the people of&nbsp;
Ukraine and the preparation of its great future.
