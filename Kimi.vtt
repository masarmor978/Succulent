00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.350
I am Kimi Iwasaki, born in “1902”, in
a village called Fuji mimura in the foothills

2
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.920
of old Shizu oka prefecture.

3
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.140
At the age of three, I was adopted by an American
missionary couple, The Hewett family.

4
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.150
My mother, Kayo, being poor, had surrendered
me in the belief that she was doing the best

5
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.630
thing for her daughter.

6
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.070
I am linked to a song that almost every Japanese
person knows, that is The Little Girl with

7
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.230
Red Shoes On, or as it’s called locally
,Akai Kutsu.

8
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.430
In the song, a young girl accompanies a foreigner
by ship from Yokohama, presumably headed for

9
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.140
the United States.

10
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.460
In the song, the mother wonders if her daughter
is happy and if her eyes have turned blue

11
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.600
like a foreigner’s.

12
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.050
The lyrics reflect my mother’s belief that
the Hewetts had taken me home with them.

13
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.820
In fact, contrary to the words of the song,
I had never left Japan at all.

14
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.420
When it was time for the Hewetts to leave,
it was discovered that I had tuberculosis,

15
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.530
which was incurable at that time.

16
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.299
It seemed doubtful that I would survive the
long ocean voyage, so I was left in a Methodist

17
00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.600
church orphanage in the AzabuJuban area of
Tokyo.

18
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.770
There, I died on “1911”, at the age of
nine.

19
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.359
Meanwhile, My mother had married Shiro Suzuki
and migrated with him to, sapporo where he

20
00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:23.130
found a job in a small newspaper publishing
company.

21
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.840
One of Shiro coworkers – Named Ujo Noguchi
- heard my story from my mother and wrote

22
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.329
the lyrics to “Akai Kutsu” . My mother
always sang the song with her voice full of

23
00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.329
sadness and regret.

24
00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.790
The song is very popular without being linked
to the original story until a newspaper chanced

25
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.020
to publish a story on the girl’s tragic
life in “1973”, and my life became widely

26
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.240
known around the country.

27
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.320
In “1989”, a statue of me was erected
in Tokyo.

28
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.490
On the day it was first unveiled, someone
left “40” yen at its feet.

29
00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.119
A charity was born, and today millions of
yen have been collected and donated to UNESCO

30
00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.600
and other childcare charities.

31
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.560
I may not have lived long to see the beauty
of this world, but I pray other kids can live

32
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.949
to fill it with joy and hope.
