00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:10.240
I am Anna Yaroslavna, born in 1025 in Kyiv,&nbsp;
Ukraine. I am the third wife of King Henry I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.760
of France, sister-in-law of kings Andrew the&nbsp;
first of Hungary and Harald III of Norway,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.040
and mother of Philip, King of the Franks.
I am the daughter of Grand Prince Yaroslav&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.200
the Wise of Kyiv and Ingegerd, daughter of King&nbsp;
Olof Skotkunung of Sweden. My marriage to King&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.880
Henry was to secure my family’s support against&nbsp;
the Holy Roman Empire, to obtain a male heir,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.120
and to comply with the church's regulations&nbsp;
forbidding marriage with close cousins.&nbsp;

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.840
Our marriage took place at the Reims Cathedral&nbsp;
on 1051, and the first of our three sons, later&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.520
King Philip I, was born in 1052. The name ‘Philip’&nbsp;
was very rare in France prior to that time and was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.040
likely inspired by Saint Philip who converted an&nbsp;
area identified with Kyivan Rus in the Middle Ages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.400
to Christianity. After my husband’s death in 1060,&nbsp;
I ruled France as co-regent while my son, Philip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.920
was a child. In 1061, I married Count Raoul the&nbsp;
third of Valois, resulting in our ex-communication&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:19.280
by Pope Alexander II because Raoul already had&nbsp;
a wife. After my second husband’s death in 1074,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.320
I returned to Philip’s court.
My signature in Cyrillic on a French royal charter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.760
from the 1060s is the only known example of a&nbsp;
Capetian queen's signature on parchment and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.840
only known signature of a member of the Riurykide&nbsp;
dynasty. It is the oldest extant example of Old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.680
Ukrainian handwriting. I was cited as a symbol of&nbsp;
Franco-Russian friendship and when Tsar Nicholas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.400
II visited Paris in 1896, he received a facsimile&nbsp;
copy of the charter of Soissons containing my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.400
signature. I was also been claimed as part of&nbsp;
Ukraine’s heritage, in particular, to stress&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.160
Ukraine’s ties with and aspirations to become&nbsp;
part of the Western European community. I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.160
featured on Ukrainian stamps. My life led to the&nbsp;
establishment of many connections across Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.650
I hope my global heritage remains to this day&nbsp;
across all nations to live in peace and harmony.
