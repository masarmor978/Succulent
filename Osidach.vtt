I am Pasha Osidach. Born in 1924 in Ladyzhichi,&nbsp;
Ukraine. I was a war messenger during World War&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.480
2. Famous for hiding messages in my braid.
I was walking unarmed between frontlines to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.920
convey messages across the soviet ranks. I was&nbsp;
fearless and equipped with faith and hope only.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.240
I served my duties until 1943 when&nbsp;
the Nazis caught me in Belorussia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.760
used enhanced interrogation techniques&nbsp;
on me, and then buried me alive.&nbsp;

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.720
My body was re-buried in my native village near&nbsp;
Chernobyl in 1965. Twenty years later my family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.200
decided to order a monument of their heroine from&nbsp;
local sculptor Taras Miskovets who is an author&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.640
of a lot of sculptures in the exclusion zone.
My bronze figure was ready in 1986 but never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.320
was erected in my hometown as by then&nbsp;
it had been evacuated due to radiation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.200
It remained kept in a safe place until it was&nbsp;
cleaned and erected in the Chernobyl schoolyard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.160
Then it was moved to the Chernobyl City&nbsp;
Park of Glory where you can find it today.&nbsp;

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.280
I am not the only person who served&nbsp;
her people and I won’t be the last.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.160
Our faith and love for our nation are the only&nbsp;
things that make us braver and capable of doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.240
things that we won’t usually do. I, like many&nbsp;
others, paid my life to keep my nation free.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.191
I hope it is still to this day&nbsp;
flourishing with free hearts.
