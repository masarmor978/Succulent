1
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.210
I am Tokugawa Ieyasu , born in “1542”,
as a son of the lord of the province of Mikawa.

2
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.100
I served as a warrior, statesman and founder
of the Tokugawa dynasty of shoguns.

3
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.330
I am considered by scholars as one of the
most significant figures in Japanese history.

4
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.430
At the time of my birth, Japan was convulsed
by civil war, with violent feuds between territorial

5
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.860
lords which had lasted for nearly a century.

6
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.580
When I was four, I was sent as a hostage to
secure an alliance between my clan and the

7
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.970
neighboring Imagawa clan.

8
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.190
I was raised at their court and given the
education suitable for a nobleman.

9
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.890
In “1567”, I become the leader of the
Matsudaira after my father's death, allied

10
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.150
with Oda Nobunaga, a powerful neighbor.

11
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.560
I spent the next decade-and-a-half campaigning
with Nobunaga while expanding my own influence

12
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.690
and wealth.

13
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.530
I had gained a considerable military reputation.

14
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.880
When Nobunaga was assassinated in “1582”,
I acquired more territory, and allied with

15
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.100
Nobunaga's successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi,
who sent me to govern lands in the east of

16
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.080
Japan, attempting to contain my growing independence.

17
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.670
I made my headquarters at the small port of
Edo (where Tokyo now stands).

18
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.390
When Hideyoshi died campaigning in Korea,
I became one of the guardians of his young

19
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.770
son.

20
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.340
The leading military figures in Japan now
began to scheme against each other and civil

21
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.600
war again broke out.

22
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.840
Another of the advisers appointed by Hideyoshi
was Ishisa Mitsunari, and it was he who formed

23
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.360
the Western Army against me.

24
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.210
In “1600”, I defeated the Western Army
in the decisive battle of Sekigahara, thereby

25
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.290
achieving supremacy in Japan.

26
00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:02.329
In “1603” Emperor Go-Yōzei, ruler only
in name, gave me the historic title of shogun

27
00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.790
which represents a military governor to confirm
his pre-eminence.

28
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.780
Japan was now united under my control.

29
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.860
I worked hard to restore stability to Japan
and encouraged foreign trade, which included

30
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.470
the exchange of gifts with James I of England
and other European rulers.

31
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.920
It was only later, under my successors, that
Japan effectively isolated itself from foreign

32
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.300
contact.

33
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.209
I died in “1616” and was later deified
and my mausoleum at Nikko became one of the

34
00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.040
most important shrines in Japan.

35
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.670
I spent my life unifying Japan and forming
a nation that I hope now stands with pride,

36
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.560
power and prosperity.
