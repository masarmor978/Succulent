00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:10.260
I am Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart born in 1756,
in Salzburg, Austria. I am recognized as one

2
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.110
of the greatest composers in the history of
Western music. I brought the Viennese Classical

3
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.060
music to its highest achievements and wrote
in all the musical genres of my day and excelled

4
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.731
in everyone.
Both parents, stressed the importance of music

5
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:28.809
to their children. Together with my sister,
Nannerl, I received such intensive musical

6
00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:34.680
training that by the age of six I was a budding
composer and an accomplished keyboard performer.

7
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.240
In 1762 my father presented me as performer
at the imperial court in Vienna, and later

8
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.130
started a musical tour to most of western
Europe cities and royal families. This exposed

9
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.280
me from an early age to unusual variety of
musical styles across Europe.

10
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.170
As a teenager, my reputation as a composer
grew to a degree of maturity equal to that

11
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.840
of older established musicians. At age 12
I produced my first real operas: the German

12
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.930
Singspiel. I was made a member of an honorary
knightly order by the Pope. At age 22, I lost

13
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.000
my mother, I was unable to get hired for an
opera and unable to secure global theater

14
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.150
presence. Wrapped with disappointment, I then
moved to Vienna where I made the greatest

15
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.610
developments in a short span in the history
of music. My music grew rapidly beyond the

16
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.830
realm of many of my contemporaries. Those
skills led to my greatest operas. In my last

17
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.460
opera, The Magic Flute, I produced a work
combining many strands of popular theater

18
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.630
including musical expressions ranging from
folk to opera.

19
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.200
I turned to work on what was to be my last
project, the Requiem. Ill and exhausted, I

20
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.330
managed to finish the first two movements,
but the last three sections were entirely

21
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.830
lacking. It was completed by my pupil Franz
SÃ¼ssmayer after my death, which occurred

22
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.770
at age 35. My life was a mix of ups and downs
but I believed that the music is not in the

23
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.530
notes, but in the silence between. I hope
these silences are inspiring the world to

24
00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.909
this day.
