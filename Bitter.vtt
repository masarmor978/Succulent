00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.670
I am the bitter memory of a childhood monument.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.090
I was created in 2014 to commemorate the millions
of victims of enforced starvation in Ukraine

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.640
between 1932 and 1933.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.560
The Holodomor, also known as the Terror-Famine
or the Great Famine was a man-made famine

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.460
in Soviet Ukraine.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.330
The Holodomor famine was part of the wider
Soviet famine of 1932–1933 which affected

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.400
the major grain-producing areas of the country.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.690
While scholars universally agree that the
cause of the famine was man-made, whether

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.010
or not the Holodomor constitutes a genocide
remains in dispute.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.940
Some historians conclude that the famine was
planned and exacerbated by Joseph Stalin to

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.150
eliminate a Ukrainian independence movement.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.610
Others suggest that the famine arose because
of rapid Soviet industrialization and the

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.580
collectivization of agriculture.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.539
Ukraine was one of the largest grain-producing
states in the USSR, and as a result, was hit

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.059
particularly hard by the famine.

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.560
Early estimates of the death toll by scholars
and government officials vary greatly.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.729
A joint statement to the United Nations signed
by 25 countries in 2003 declared that 7 to

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.609
10 million died.

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:21.229
However, current scholarship estimates a range
significantly lower, with 3 to 5 million victims.

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.200
The famine's widespread impact on Ukraine
persists to this day.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.319
Since 2006, the Holodomor has been recognized
by Ukraine alongside 15 other countries, as

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:35.630
a genocide against the Ukrainian people, carried
out by the Soviet regime.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.880
There is no benefit in starving another fellow
human to death no matter what is the crime

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.049
they made.

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.899
Our crime was living on our land.

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.709
Children, women, elders, and exhausted men
paid the price.

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.989
We hope innocent souls are not paying the
price of humanity’s greed and selfishness

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:53.359
anymore.
