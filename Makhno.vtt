00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.800
I am Nestor Makhno. Born in 1888&nbsp;
in Huliaipole, current-day Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.280
I am a Ukrainian anarchist revolutionary&nbsp;
and the commander of the Revolutionary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:21.840
Insurgent Army of Ukraine from 1917 to 1921.
My family was a poor peasant family in Huliaipole.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.840
I was the youngest of five children born to&nbsp;
former serfs who had been emancipated in 1861.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.200
In school I proved to be a gifted student,&nbsp;
excelling in arithmetic and reading.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.920
However, my family's extreme poverty forced me&nbsp;
to begin working in the fields full-time, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.280
led me to develop a sort of rage, resentment,&nbsp;
and even hatred for the wealthy property owner.&nbsp;

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.480
In 1905, a predominantly peasant phenomenon grew&nbsp;
into a mass social movement near my hometown.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.520
Over the course of the Russian Civil&nbsp;
War, this movement came to exert a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.200
strong influence over large areas of southern&nbsp;
Ukraine. I and the movement's leadership were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.000
anarcho-communists and attempted to guide&nbsp;
the movement along these ideological lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.360
I was aggressively opposed to all factions&nbsp;
that sought to impose their authority over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.640
southern Ukraine, battling in succession the&nbsp;
forces of the Ukrainian People's Republic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:26.000
Central Powers, White Army, Red Army, and other&nbsp;
smaller forces led by various Ukrainian atamans.&nbsp;

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.360
My supporters attempted to reorganize social&nbsp;
and economic life along anarchist lines,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.600
including the establishment of communes on former&nbsp;
landed estates. However, the disruption of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.720
civil war precluded a stable territorial&nbsp;
base for any long-term social experiments.&nbsp;

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.840
In the aftermath of the White Army's defeat in&nbsp;
Crimea in November 1920, the Bolsheviks initiated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.920
a military campaign against my forces. After&nbsp;
an extended period of open resistance against&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.560
the Red Army, I was sent to exile in Paris.&nbsp;
During this period, I wrote numerous memoirs and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.800
articles for radical newspapers. I also played an&nbsp;
important role in the development of platformism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.720
and the debates around the 1926 Organizational&nbsp;
Platform of the General Union of Anarchists.&nbsp;

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.800
I died in 1934 in Paris at the age of 45 from&nbsp;
tuberculosis-related causes. I dreamed about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.566
Ukrainians living in dignity, peace, and harmony.&nbsp;
I hope my nation is eternally flourishing.
