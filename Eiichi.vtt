00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.630
I am Shishaku Shibusawa Eiichi, born at “1840”
in Musashi province, I am also known as the

2
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.460
"father of Japanese capitalism".

3
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.320
I was a Japanese government official who helped
establish the reforms that put Japan on a

4
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.720
firm financial footing in the Meiji period.

5
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.050
My Shibusawa Company became one of the largest
of the financial cartels in the country, helping

6
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.110
establish the close relations between government
and business.

7
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.680
My parents were not wealthy; however, they
could afford to give me a good education.

8
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.270
I early joined the loyalist movement that
demanded the expulsion of all foreigners from

9
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.760
Japan.

10
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.750
Because of my ability I became a member of
the staff of Tokugawa Yoshinobu, who granted

11
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.050
me samurai status.

12
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.890
Later I was made a member of the central government.

13
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.930
I soon changed my expulsions ideas, went to
a visit around Europe.

14
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.300
On my return home, I discovered that the shogunate
had been overthrown and replaced by an imperial

15
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.630
government under the emperor Meiji.

16
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.750
I reformed the Japanese banking and trading.

17
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.610
In October “1869” I joined the government
as an official in the tax ministry and helped

18
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.940
carry out currency and tax reforms, revision
of the system of weights and measures, and

19
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.340
development of a new method of provincial
administration.

20
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.240
In “1873” I resigned from the government
as a result of a policy disagreement and became

21
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.840
president of the First National Bank, current
day Daiichi Kangyo Bank of Japan, which I

22
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.840
had helped found.

23
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.400
That same year I founded the Oji Paper Manufacturing
Company, and “10” years later I began

24
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.930
the famous Osaka Spinning Company.

25
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.710
Larger and more efficient than any other of
its kind, this plant established my dominance

26
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.170
over Japanese industrial life.

27
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.270
I, in fact, was involved in almost every enterprise
associated with the country’s industrial

28
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.210
development in this period, founding railways,
steamship companies, fisheries, printing companies,

29
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.159
steel plants, gas and electric industries,
and oil and mining concerns.

30
00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:16.269
I retired in “1916” to devote myself to
social welfare causes, in which I actively

31
00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.900
continued until my death at “1931”.

32
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.989
I lived to make Japan a global economical
power and to let Japanese people live in prosperity.

33
00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.069
I hope today everyone is benefiting from my
reforms.
