I am Maria Zankovetska. born in 1854 in&nbsp;
Zankiv, I am a Ukrainian theater actress.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.480
I was a star of Ukrainian theater of the late&nbsp;
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and am&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.160
one of the brightest females leads to have&nbsp;
played on the stages across the country.&nbsp;

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.680
I was born into a family of impoverished&nbsp;
landowners and noblemen. I was a graduate of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.640
the Chernihiv City Female Gymnasium and in 1876,&nbsp;
I came out on a stage of the Nizhyn theater. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.480
city of Nizhyn became my native town where I kept&nbsp;
my own building. My professional career started&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.440
in 1882 in the Yelizavetgrad City Theater. My&nbsp;
first role was Natalka from the Kotlyarevsky play&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.320
"Natalka Poltavka". Later I participated among the&nbsp;
most popular and professional Ukrainian troupes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.560
My stage name Zankovetska was derived from&nbsp;
the name of the village where I was born.&nbsp;

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.600
My professional career at Zankovetska's&nbsp;
accounted for over 30 roles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.160
My characters were dramatic heroes.&nbsp;
I sang in a mezzo-soprano voice and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.160
created images that were penetrated&nbsp;
with a real drama and a fiery comedy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.880
Having a charming voice, and a dramatic soprano,&nbsp;
I incomparably performed in Ukrainian folk songs.&nbsp;

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.240
In 1918, I organized a people's&nbsp;
theater. Several plays were set&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.840
among which were "Natalka Poltavka",&nbsp;
"Hetman Doroshenko", and "Aza the Gypsy".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.680
In 1922 Ukraine triumphantly celebrated the 40th&nbsp;
anniversary of my career. I was the first person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.160
in Ukraine to whom the government awarded the&nbsp;
high title of the People's Artist of the republic.&nbsp;

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.240
I died in 1934. Nearly all girls dream of becoming&nbsp;
actresses, but with time, this fancy fades away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.000
I hold tight to my dreams and&nbsp;
followed that light in my heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.800 --> 00:02:00.480
My message was heard across generations and&nbsp;
you too can let the world live your dream.
