00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:10.250
I am Nelson Mandela, born in 1918 in Mvezo,
South Africa. I am nationalist and the first

2
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:17.080
Black president of South Africa. My negotiations
in the early 1990s with South African President,

3
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.770
Klerk helped end the country’s apartheid
system of racial segregation and ushered in

4
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.650
a peaceful transition to majority rule. Klerk
and I were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize

5
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.000
for Peace in 1993 for our efforts.
I was born as the son of Chief Henry Mandela

6
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.501
of the Madiba clan of the Tembu people. I
studied law at Witwatersrand University. In

7
00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:47.830
1944 I joined the African National Congress
or ANC and became a leader of its Youth League.

8
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.930
I opposed the apartheid policies of the ruling
National Party.

9
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.350
I defiance against South Africa’s pass laws,
which required nonwhites to carry documents

10
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.290
authorizing their presence in areas that the
government deemed “restricted”. After

11
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.970
the 1960 massacre of unarmed Black South Africans
by police at Sharpeville and the subsequent

12
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.130
banning of the ANC, I abandoned my nonviolent
stance and began advocating acts of sabotage

13
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.920
against the South African regime. In 1962
I went to Algeria for training in guerrilla

14
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.070
warfare, returning to South Africa later that
year.

15
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.300
In 1963, I, with other men were tried for
violent conspiracy in the infamous Rivonia

16
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:38.130
Trial. There, I gave a speech that was published
globally titled as “I Am Prepared to Die”.

17
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.350
I was imprisoned until 1990 while retaining
wide support among South Africa’s Black

18
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.210
population. I led the negotiations with south
African president to end apartheid and bring

19
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:57.470
about a peaceful transition to nonracial democracy
in South Africa. In 1994, We won South Africa’s

20
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.100
first elections. I introduced housing, education,
and economic development initiatives designed

21
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.270
to improve living standards of the country’s
Black population.

22
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.989
I retired from active politics in 1999 but
maintained a strong international presence

23
00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.939
as an advocate of peace. I later become global
symbol of conflict resolution and problem

24
00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:26.629
solving. I died in 2013 at the age of 95 after
suffering from a prolonged respiratory infection.

25
00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.969
A true leader must be ready to sacrifice all
for the freedom of their people. I hope all

26
00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:36.219
your hearts are still fighting for peace and
justice around the world.
