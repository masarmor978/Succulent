00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:09.520
I am Kwame Nkrumah, born in 1909 in Nkroful,&nbsp;
Gold Coast, current-day Ghana. I am a Ghanaian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.840
nationalist leader who led the Gold Coast’s drive&nbsp;
for independence from Britain and presided over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.120
it's emergence as the new nation of Ghana. I&nbsp;
headed the country from independence in1957&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.800
until I was overthrown by a coup in 1966.
I grew up in a Roman Catholic environment and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.680
became a teacher at Roman Catholic junior&nbsp;
schools. Increasingly drawn to politics,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.640
I decided to pursue further studies in the&nbsp;
United States. I entered Lincoln University&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.880
and studied the literature of socialism.&nbsp;
I also immersed myself in political work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.520
and became president of the African Students’&nbsp;
Organization of the United States and Canada.&nbsp;

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.600
I returned home in 1947 that was colonized by&nbsp;
Britain. I become United Gold Coast Convention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920
general secretary and began to create a mass&nbsp;
base for the new movement and the British briefly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.840
arrested me and other party leaders. In 1950,&nbsp;
I initiated a campaign of “positive action,”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.240
involving nonviolent protests, strikes, and&nbsp;
noncooperation with the British colonial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.280
authorities. I was arrested numerous times,&nbsp;
but the Gold Coast’s first general election&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.800
led to the victory of my party, and I&nbsp;
was released from prison to become the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.560
leader of the government business and later&nbsp;
became the prime minister of the Gold Coast.&nbsp;

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.160
My popularity in the country rose due to opening&nbsp;
new roads, schools, and health facilities and due&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.480
to the policy of Africanization that created&nbsp;
better career opportunities for Ghanaians.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.600
In 1960, I concentrated my attention on&nbsp;
campaigning for the political unity of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.880
Black Africa. My administration became involved&nbsp;
in magnificent development projects but due to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.520
the widespread labor unrest and due to&nbsp;
the general strike in September 1961,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.920
many of those projects failed&nbsp;
to reach their goals. In 1966,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.680
the army in Ghana seized power and I sought asylum&nbsp;
in Guinea, to die later in Bucharest in 1972.&nbsp;

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.320
I am not African because I was born in&nbsp;
Africa but because Africa was born in me.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.268
I hope my nation has met peace and prosperity&nbsp;
after all the struggles we went through.
