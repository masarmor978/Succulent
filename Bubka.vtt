00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:09.680
I am Sergey Bubka. Born in 1963 in Luhansk ,&nbsp;
Ukraine. I am a Soviet and Ukrainian former&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.800
pole vaulter. I represented the Soviet&nbsp;
Union until its dissolution in 1991.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.280
I was twice named Athlete of the Year by Track&nbsp;
&amp; Field News and in 2012 was one of 24 athletes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.640
inducted as inaugural members of the International&nbsp;
Association of Athletics Federations Hall of Fame.&nbsp;

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.560
I was a track-and-field athlete in the 100-meter&nbsp;
dash and the long jump but became a world-class&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.880
champion only when I turned to the pole vault.&nbsp;
In 1983, virtually unknown internationally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.400
I won the world championship in Helsinki, Finland,&nbsp;
and the following year set my first world record,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.480
clearing 5.85 meters. I became noted for&nbsp;
establishing new records by slim amounts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.600
sometimes as little as a centimeter higher.&nbsp;
This allowed me to collect frequent rewards and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.240
made me an attraction at track-and-field meets.
I won six consecutive IAAF World Championships,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.960
an Olympic gold medal, and broke the world&nbsp;
record for men's pole vault 35 times.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.160
I was the first pole vaulter to&nbsp;
clear 6.0 meters and 6.1 meters.&nbsp;

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.720
I held the indoor world record of 6.15 meters, set&nbsp;
on 1993 in Donetsk, Ukraine for almost 21 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.720
until France's Renaud Lavillenie cleared 6.16&nbsp;
meters on 2014 at the same meet in the same arena.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.880
I held the outdoor world record at&nbsp;
6.14 meters between 1994 and 2020.&nbsp;

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.560
I am Senior Vice President of the International&nbsp;
Association of Athletics Federations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.360
serving since 2007, and President of the&nbsp;
National Olympic Committee of Ukraine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.200
serving since 2005. I am also an Honorary&nbsp;
Member of the International Olympic Committee,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.240
having been involved since 1996.
The strategy of my coach and me was that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.040
looked at pictures of all the best pole vaulters&nbsp;
from around the world, and we took the best parts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.560
from them, and we imagined a person that had never&nbsp;
existed. We then started to work toward being such&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.854
a person. So does your dream. Make it happen&nbsp;
by imagining all the great pieces forming it.
