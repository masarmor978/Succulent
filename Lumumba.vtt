00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.920
I am Patrice Lumumba, born in 1925 in Onalua&nbsp;
in Kasai province of the Belgian Congo.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.240
I am the first prime minister of the Republic of&nbsp;
Congo after liberation from Belgian colonial rule.&nbsp;

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.360
Early in life, I developed interests in grassroots&nbsp;
union activities and joined the Postal Union. As&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.040
secretary-general of the union, I began publishing&nbsp;
essays critical of Belgian colonial rule and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:35.200
advocating independence and a unified centralized&nbsp;
Congo. My writings appealed beyond ethnic and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:42.400
regional loyalties to a national constituency.
In 1955, I became regional leader of the Circle of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.440
Stanleyville and joined the Belgian Liberal Party.&nbsp;
To solidify my political base, in 1957 I helped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.720
found a broad-based organization that appealed&nbsp;
beyond ethnic and regional loyalties—Movement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.520
National Congolese that I represented at&nbsp;
the Pan-African Conference in Accra, Ghana.&nbsp;

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.320
My relentless attacks on Belgian rule soon&nbsp;
resulted in a leadership split in July 1959.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.280
Undaunted, I insisted on the complete dismantling&nbsp;
of Belgian rule. As a result, I got exiled to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.280
Brussels where I boldly condemned Belgian rule&nbsp;
and advocated immediate independence. Convinced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.080
of the imminence of Congolese freedom, in 1960,&nbsp;
Belgium gave Congo its independence in 1960.&nbsp;

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.960
The Movement National Congolese won&nbsp;
the majority in the general election,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.520
and I became prime minister of the Congo, with my&nbsp;
political rival Joseph Kasavubu as president. My&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.800
scathing denunciation of colonialism ruffled&nbsp;
feathers not only in Belgium but also in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.960
United States and Great Britain. Unfortunately,&nbsp;
my tenure was brief and marred in crises.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.000
It began with the army revolt and secession in&nbsp;
Katanga and Southern Kasai that led to putting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.040
me under house arrest. I made the fateful&nbsp;
attempt to escape to Stanleyville where my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.080
supporters had gained control. I was apprehended&nbsp;
by secessionist rebels and assassinated in 1961.&nbsp;

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.280
I became a symbol of Congolese and African&nbsp;
freedom and being remembered today as one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.840
of the African leaders truly dedicated to&nbsp;
national unity and genuine independence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.400
I prefer to die with my head raised&nbsp;
high, with unshakeable faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.501
I pray our beloved Congo is blessed&nbsp;
with the world’s best living standards.
