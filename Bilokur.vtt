00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.480
I am Kateryna Bilokur.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.340
Born in 1900 in Bogdanivka, Ukraine.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.080
I was a Ukrainian folk artist.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.629
I was named People's Artist of Ukraine and
have been appreciated by global artists and

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:14.629
minds.

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:20.250
After an unpromising start, my works became
known in the late 1930s and 1940s for their

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.250
interest in nature.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.280
I am a self-taught master of primitive art
and decorative folk painting.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.890
I painted flowers and fruits in gardens, orchards,
fields, still lives, and several portraits

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.240
and self-portraits.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.530
My paintings display originality, vivid coloring,
and great attention to detail.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.960
In 1954, three of my paintings were exhibited
at an international exhibition in Paris where,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.790
among others, they were highly praised by
Pablo Picasso.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.629
My work is preserved at the National Museum
of Ukrainian Decorative Folk Art.

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.750
Albums of my paintings were published in Kyiv
in 1959, 1975, and 2010.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.670
In 1949, I became a member of the Artists
Union of Ukraine.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.390
I was awarded the "Badge of Honor" and the
title of "People's Artist" of the Ukrainian

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.410
SSR.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.710
In subsequent years, my works were regularly
exhibited at exhibitions in Poltava, Kyiv,

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.600
Moscow, and other cities.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.490
My reputation and connections attracted global
attention from artists, critics, and lecturers.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.650
I would often combine spring and autumn elements
or features in my paintings.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.150
I made brushes myself.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.330
I took hairs of the same length from a cat's
tail.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.060
Each painting has its own brush.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.820
I figured out the canvas priming technique
by myself.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.710
In 1948, I was living with my sick mother
for a while, and later - my brotherâ€™s family

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.960
moved in with us.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.040
I suffered from severe pain in the abdomen
and legs.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.189
Home remedies did not help, and the village
pharmacy did not have the necessary medicines.

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.310
In 1961, my mother and I died of illness and
were buried in our native village.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.759
I always listened to my heart and it brought
me lots of harmony and beautiful thoughts.

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.770
I wanted to share my worldview with everyone
else through my brushes and eyes.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.159
I hope we can all see the true charm of our
lives.
