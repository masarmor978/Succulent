00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.510
I am Alexander Fleming, born in Ayrshire,
United Kingdom, in 1881.I was a Scottish bacteriologist

2
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.490
and Nobel Prize winner, best known for my
discovery of penicillin

3
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.860
I moved to London at the age of 13 and later
trained as a doctor. I qualified with distinction

4
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.040
in 1906 and began research at St Mary's Hospital
Medical School at the University of London

5
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.660
under Sir Almroth Wright, a pioneer in vaccine
therapy. In World War One, I served in the

6
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.920
Army Medical Corps and was mentioned in dispatches.
After the war, I returned to St Mary's.

7
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.859
In 1928, while studying influenza, I noticed
that mold had developed accidentally on a

8
00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.980
set of culture dishes being used to grow the
staphylococci germ. The mold had created a

9
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.379
bacteria-free circle around itself. I experimented
further and named the active substance penicillin.

10
00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.289
It was two other scientists however, Australian
Howard Florey and Ernst Chain, a refugee from

11
00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.489
Nazi Germany, who developed penicillin further
so that it could be produced as a drug. At

12
00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.310
first supplies of penicillin were very limited,
but by the 1940s it was being mass-produced

13
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.020
by the American drugs industry.
I wrote numerous papers on bacteriology, immunology,

14
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.040
and chemotherapy. I was elected professor
at the medical school in 1928 and emeritus

15
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.079
professor of bacteriology at the University
of London. I was elected fellow of the Royal

16
00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:30.409
Society and knighted. In 1945, I shared the
Nobel Prize in Medicine with two other scientists.

17
00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.820
I died on 11 March 1955. For the birth of
something new, there has to be a happening.

18
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.259
Newton saw an apple fall; James Watt watched
a kettle boil; Roentgen fogged some photographic

19
00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.210
plates. And these people knew enough to translate
ordinary happenings into something new. Nature

20
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.380
makes penicillin; I just found it. I hope
my research has contributed to helping humans

21
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.380
to live healthier. I also wish that we never
stop observing our surroundings as the secret

22
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.393
of a happier life may be hiding in our shelves
without us knowing.
