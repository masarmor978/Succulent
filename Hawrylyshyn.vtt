I am Bohdan Hawrylyshyn. Born in 1926 in Koropets,&nbsp;
I am a Canadian, Swiss, and Ukrainian economist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.640
thinker, benefactor, and advisor to governments&nbsp;
and large companies worldwide. I was a full member&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.920
of the Club of Rome, a long-time director of&nbsp;
Switzerland's International Management Institute,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.480
a founder of the European Management Forum&nbsp;
in Davos, a fellow, and a member of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.400
Board of the World Academy of Art and Science.
I spent most of my childhood on my father's farm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.680
During World War II, I was captured by the Nazis&nbsp;
in 1944 and displaced to Germany. After the war, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.720
spent almost two years in a displaced person camp&nbsp;
and afterward moved to Canada as a lumberjack.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.120
While working at various jobs I was admitted to&nbsp;
the University of Toronto. My admission received&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.240
media coverage and public disruption, as I was the&nbsp;
first refugee to get admitted to the university&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.360
in Canada. In 1952 I graduated with a BA and an&nbsp;
MA in engineering at the University of Toronto.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.960
I later worked as an engineer, researcher,&nbsp;
and manager at various enterprises worldwide.&nbsp;

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.360
I also was a consultant for General Electric,&nbsp;
IBM, Unilever, and Philips and an advisor to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.280
several countries. After Ukraine declared&nbsp;
independence in 1991, I was an advisor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.160
to several Ukrainian prime ministers, and to&nbsp;
most chairmen of the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada.&nbsp;

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.000
In 1991, I created and became the head of&nbsp;
the Council of Advisors to the Presidium of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.440
the Ukrainian Parliament. I also facilitated&nbsp;
the establishment of the International Centre&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.040
for Policy Studies. In Ukraine, the fruitful&nbsp;
activities of my work are highly appreciated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.560
by a broad community of education, science,&nbsp;
and state officials. I was elected a foreign&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.120
member of the National Academy of Sciences&nbsp;
of Ukraine and was awarded an Order of Merit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.640
I am a merited scientist of Ukraine and held&nbsp;
honorary doctorates from numerous institutes.&nbsp;

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.120
I died in 2016 at the age of 90 in Kyiv, Ukraine,&nbsp;
doing my best for my nation and the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.928
To you I whisper, Learn, Dream, Act.&nbsp;
This is how you make anything a reality.
