00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:11.920
I am Ino Tadataka, surveyor and a cartographer
who made the first surveyed map of Japan.

2
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:19.490
I was born in Kujukuri, Chiba Prefecture,
in 1745, and was adopted by the Ino rice wine

3
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.910
brewer family in Sawara when I was 17 years
old. I wanted to know how large the Earth

4
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.850
was by measuring 1 degree of the planet's
latitude. When I was 55 years old, I surveyed

5
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.990
and mapped the island of Ezo, now day Hokkaido.
I counted my own strides and steps. Later

6
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:47.460
I surveyed whole of Japan using ropes and
iron chains. Astronomical observations were

7
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.950
also used to measure the latitude of locations.
With my survey team, we spent 17 years walking

8
00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:02.180
around the country traveling a total distance
of about 43,707 kilometers. The team made

9
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.570
a scale and poked pinholes at the corners
of each surveyed section and connected the

10
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.590
dots with ink to produce an outline. The final
version of my work, which amounted to 225

11
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:21.200
pages, was finally submitted to the shogunate
in 1821, three years after my death. I hope

12
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.900
you found my maps useful.
