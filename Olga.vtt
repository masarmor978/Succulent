00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:09.680
I am Olga of kyiv, Born at end of the 9th century&nbsp;
in Pskov, Russia. I am a regent of Kievan Rus' for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.120
my son Sviatoslav. I am one of the most vicious&nbsp;
and vengeful rulers in the history of the Kievan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.120
Rusâ€™, the principality that would eventually give&nbsp;
birth to modern Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.280
stretching at its height from the Baltic Sea&nbsp;
in the North to the Black Sea in the South.&nbsp;

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.200
I am from a family of Vikings origin who came&nbsp;
to the territory of current Russia, Ukraine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.680
and Belarus during the 8th and 9th centuries. I&nbsp;
married Prince Igor and had our son Svyatoslav.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.280
My husband went to the Slavic tribe of the&nbsp;
Drevlyans to gather tributes. After he demanded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.120
a much higher payment, the Drevlyans killed him.
My son was three years old so I took the power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.640
into my hands. I had the full support of the&nbsp;
Rus army, which attests to the great respect I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.480
held among the people. I poured my full rage on&nbsp;
the Drevlyans , killing all of the ambassadors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.320
besieging many of their towns, and&nbsp;
destroying anyone who opposed my rule.&nbsp;

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.920
While my grownup son was organizing military&nbsp;
campaigns in order to widen and strengthen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.560
the borders of our state, I was in charge&nbsp;
of the internal policies of Kievan Rus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.520
and became known for establishing the system of&nbsp;
tribute gathering and fixing amounts of tributes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.920
with a detailed schedule for their gathering.
I introduced the stone building and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.200
Christianity in Kievan Rus cities establishing&nbsp;
connections with Byzantine and Western European&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.680
churches to know more about Christianity.
In 968, Kyiv was attacked by the Pechenegs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.000
a semi-nomadic Turkic people. I, together with my&nbsp;
young grandchildren, had to organize the defense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.040
of the city. I died soon after Kyiv's siege in 969&nbsp;
defending my land. In 1547, the Orthodox Church&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.880
proclaimed me a saint and equal to the apostles.&nbsp;
I became one of only five women to be honored with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.411
this status in the history of Christianity.&nbsp;
Protect the love of your nation at any cost.
