00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.880
I am Borys Paton. Born in 1918 in Kyiv,&nbsp;
Ukraine. I am a Soviet and Ukrainian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.200
scientist and a long-time chairman of the&nbsp;
National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.480
I am famous for my work in electric welding.
I am the son of a scientist and founder of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.520
the Paton Institute of Electric Welding&nbsp;
in Kyiv, Professor Evgeny Paton. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.560
first welded bridge in Kyiv, Paton Bridge, was&nbsp;
constructed under the supervision of my father.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.000
I was born in the professorsâ€™ residence building&nbsp;
of Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, where my father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.240
was teaching. In 1941, I completed the Kyiv&nbsp;
Polytechnic Institute and became an engineer.&nbsp;

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.120
During the Second World War, I worked and&nbsp;
designed electric circuits that helped to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.960
increase Soviet tank production. I had a doctoral&nbsp;
degree in technical sciences after I defended my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.320
doctoral dissertation in 1952. In 1953 I became&nbsp;
head of the Paton Institute of Electric Welding.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.640
I never fully denounced Ukraine's&nbsp;
past as part of the Soviet Union.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.400
I declared I was against decommunization policies.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.160
I joined the National Academy of Sciences&nbsp;
of Ukraine and the USSR Academy of Science.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.960
I was offered to head the USSR Academy&nbsp;
of Sciences in Moscow, but I refused.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.040
I was convinced that I should work&nbsp;
in Kyiv, at my parents' Institute of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.920
Electric Welding and the Ukrainian Academy&nbsp;
of Sciences. I was the author of more than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.680
1,000 publications, including 20 monographs,&nbsp;
and responsible for more than 400 inventions.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.240
I died on 2020 aged 101. My life was filled&nbsp;
with challenges. All our lives will be like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.160
that. I decided to look for an opportunity and use&nbsp;
reality to make my dreams happen. I wish we all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.145
make a better future, not only for ourselves but&nbsp;
for those who are coming to the world after us.
