00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:10.280
I am Ludwig Van Beethoveen, born in 1770 in
Germany. My talent for the piano was soon

2
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.090
realized and I gave my first public performance
at the age of eight. Later, I was employed

3
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:23.289
as a court musician in Bonn from 1787. During
this time, I studied briefly under both Haydn

4
00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.950
and Mozart, although it was certainly not
a satisfying relationship for me. My works

5
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.690
rank amongst the most performed of the classical
music repertoire. It spans the transition

6
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.460
from the classical period to the romantic
era in classical music.

7
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.630
In 1800, I abandoned the classical forms of
the previous century and set out for a more

8
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.820
expressive or so called, Romantic musical
voice. My musical imagination began to grow

9
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.550
beyond that of the piano. Scholars call this
period of my life as the Heroic Period because

10
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.090
of the “larger than life” nature that
my compositions took on, saw the creations

11
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:08.409
of such masterpieces as the Tempest Sonata,
Eroica, Fidelio, and the 5th Piano Concerto.

12
00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.360
In about a decade, I composed piece after
piece that marked me as a masterful composer

13
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.270
reaching my musical maturity. I demonstrated
complete mastery of that most difficult and

14
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.909
cherished of the Viennese forms developed
by Mozart and Haydn. In 1809, however, my

15
00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.700
musical output began to drop due to family
issue and approaching deafness. This lasted

16
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.420
until 1818. At this point I was completely
deaf and was going through lawsuit to win

17
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.220
custody over my nephew, Karl, though I hardly
won his affection. I composed my most beautiful

18
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.799
and extraordinary music while deaf which is
considered an almost superhuman feat of creative

19
00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.479
genius, perhaps only paralleled in the history
of artistic achievement by John Milton writing

20
00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:02.200
Paradise Lost while blind.
I died in 1827, at the age of 56, of liver

21
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.090
failure. My body of musical compositions stands
with William Shakespeare's plays at the outer

22
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.470
limits of human brilliance. My affliction
didn’t prevent me from embracing the world

23
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.400
and immortally inspiring millions of people
hearts and souls. Friends applaud, the comedy

24
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.840
is over.
