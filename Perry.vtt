00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.600
I am Matthew Calbraith Perry, born on “1794” in 
South Kingston, the united states of America,  

2
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.760
I am a naval officer who headed an expedition 
that forced Japan in “1853” to enter into  

3
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.640
trade and diplomatic relations with the West 
after more than two centuries of isolation.  

4
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.440
Through my efforts the United States 
became an equal power with Britain,  

5
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.200
France, and Russia in the economic 
exploitation of East Asia. 

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.440
I had served as commanding officer during 
the “1830’s” of the first U.S. steamship,  

7
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.760
the “Fulton”; led a naval squadron to Africa 
to help suppress the slave trade “1843”;  

8
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:51.360
and successfully commanded naval forces 
during the Mexican War “1846”. In “1852”  

9
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.800
I was in charge of a naval expedition to induce 
the Japanese government to establish diplomatic  

10
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.560
relations with the United States. With two 
frigates and two sailing vessels, I entered  

11
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.560
the fortified harbor of Uraga on “1853”—an 
act widely publicized throughout the world.  

12
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.360
The Japanese defenses were inadequate to resist my 
ships, and after a few days of diplomatic sparring  

13
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.760
they accepted my letter from the President 
of the United States requesting a treaty. 

14
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.720
In the interim, the Japanese, who 
were aware of China’s recent defeat  

15
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.400
by the technologically superior Western 
powers in the Opium War in the “1839”,  

16
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.520
decided to agree to my terms as a way of stalling 
for time while they improved their defenses.  

17
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.680
In “1854”, I reappeared in Edo Bay, current 
day Tokyo, this time with nine ships—and  

18
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.160
concluded the Treaty of Kanagawa, the 
first treaty between the two countries.  

19
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.960
The pact assured better treatment of shipwrecked 
seamen, permitted U.S. ships to obtain fuel and  

20
00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.040
supplies at two minor ports, arranged for a U.S. 
consul to reside at Shimoda, and opened the way  

21
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.040
for further U.S. trading privileges. These events 
contributed to the collapse of the shogunate and  

22
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.080
ultimately to the modernization of Japan.
In “1855” I return to the united states and  

23
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.280
received appreciation for my efforts in the east 
and started publishing my reports about my journey  

24
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.480
under the title “Narrative of the Expedition 
of an American Squadron to the China Seas and  

25
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:32.080
Japan “. I spent my last year’s preparing for my 
publication, announcing its completion on “1857”  

26
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.240
and died one year later, of rheumatic fever. I 
cruised the world trying to break walls between  

27
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:48.800
nations and I hope the world has become 
more open and understanding for each other.
