00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:10.400
I am Julius Kambarage Nyerere. Born in 1922 in&nbsp;
Butiama, on the eastern shore of Lake Victoria&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.480
in Tanganyika, Current day Tanzania. I am&nbsp;
one of Africa’s most respected figures.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.560
Being the major force behind the&nbsp;
Organization of the African Union.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.120
I am also Tanganyika's first prime minister&nbsp;
and the first president of Tanzania.
 &nbsp;

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.840
I am the son of Chief Nyerere Burito. I finished&nbsp;
my bachelor’s study in Uganda and was selected to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.960
do my master’s in economics at Edinburgh&nbsp;
University. I was the first student from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.800
Tanganyika to study there. After graduating,&nbsp;
I became a teacher near Dar es Salaam.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.600
There, I joined the Tanganyika African&nbsp;
National Union, the nationalist party. In 1954,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.280
I was elected as its president and entered its&nbsp;
Legislative Council. I became prime minister of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.280
the self-governing territory of Tanganyika. After&nbsp;
years of negotiations, we gained our independence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.360
from the British in 1961. I was officially&nbsp;
elected as the nation's first president.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.280
In 1964, the territory unified with Zanzibar&nbsp;
as the United Republic of Tanzania.
 &nbsp;

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.360
In my attempt to build an independent country, I&nbsp;
developed an African national socialist plan to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.960
grow nationally and internationally, called Ujamaa&nbsp;
which means family links in Swahili language.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.960
The main idea of my project and theory was to&nbsp;
recover local traditions of community ways of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.800
working, producing, and relating to the land.&nbsp;
There was a process of nationalization of land&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.360
and companies combined with the promotion of&nbsp;
new ways of workers’ organization of labor.
 &nbsp;

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.360
I am also known as one of the main thinkers and&nbsp;
creators of the Organization of African Unity,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.080
together with Kwame Nkrumah. At the&nbsp;
same time, my government’s support&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.480
was crucial for the progress of socialist&nbsp;
liberation movements in many countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.480
In 1985, after being president for almost 30&nbsp;
years, I stepped down voluntarily. Since then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.960
I developed an international career as an&nbsp;
African thinker and leader and assisted in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:16.160
many peace negotiations among African countries.&nbsp;
I died in 1999 dreaming about African unity and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.840
wishing no one would make the color of a man's&nbsp;
skin the criteria for granting him civil rights.
