00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:14.360
I am Omura Masujiro, born in “1824” in
Suo province, current day Yamaguchi prefecture.

2
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.630
I am Japanese scholar and soldier popularly
regarded in Japan as the founder of the modern

3
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.460
Japanese Army.
After studying Confucian ethics, at “19”

4
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.890
I began studying Western learning. When I
was “23”, I went to Osaka to study Western

5
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.149
medicine. In “1850” I returned home to
practice medicine but had little success,

6
00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:43.350
and in “1853” I became an instructor in
Western learning for the Uwajima clan in Ehime

7
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.800
Prefecture. Then I became an instructor at
Tokyo government’s office for the study

8
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.519
of Western books in “1856”, and later
at the national military academy. During this

9
00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.870
period, I studied English under James Curtis
Hepburn, an American missionary, who later

10
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.410
devised a Romanized system for the Japanese
language and who was then working for the

11
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.180
Japanese government.
I also studied Western military strategy.

12
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.410
I applied the knowledge of the Western military
sciences as an adviser to the Choshu military

13
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.390
organization. There, I gained fame as a strategist
during the battles between the Choshu and

14
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.130
the forces of the shogunate in “1864”
and “1865”, before the Meiji Restoration

15
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.320
reestablished direct Imperial rule.
In “1869” I was appointed minister of

16
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.990
military affairs and planned the adoption
of a conscription system for the new Imperial

17
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.090
Army and the complete elimination of the samurai
as a warrior class. While in Kyoto inspecting

18
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.170
sites for military schools, I was assassinated
by samurai opposed to my reforms. I was posthumously

19
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.220
accorded the Junior Grade of Second Court
Rank. I created the foundation of a modern

20
00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.500
Japanese army and I hope my efforts have created
a Japanese society living in peace and harmony

21
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.170
with the world
