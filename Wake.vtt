00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:11.290
I am Wake no Kiyomaro, born in 733 in current
day Okayama prefecture. I was a high-ranking

2
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.269
official, who lived during the early Heian
Period. My family was of a political importance,

3
00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:22.529
devoted Buddhists who hoped to keep Buddhism
and politics separate through religious reform.

4
00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.109
I Become a trusted advisor to Emperor Kanmu,
a position which I used to encourage the development

5
00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.190
of Buddhism in a direction which would prevent
it from posing a threat to the government.

6
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.090
I was sent to the Usa Shrine to receive a
divine message; stating that only those of

7
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.220
descent from Amaterasu or the sun goddess
family could become emperor, it refuted the

8
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.600
previous divine message claiming a monk called
Dokyo was to be the next emperor after Empress

9
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.239
Koken. This report angered Dokyo, who used
his influence with the Empress to have an

10
00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.430
edict issued sending me into exile and only
the protection of the Fujiwara clan saved

11
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.770
me from being killed outright.
The following year, however, Empress Koken

12
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:11.229
died. She was succeeded by Emperor Konin,
who in turn exiled Dokyo to Shimotsuke Province

13
00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.649
and not only recalled me from exile, but also
appointed me as both the governor of Bizen

14
00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.049
Province and junior minister of state. The
following year, I petitioned the governor

15
00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.249
of Dazaifu to send officials to Usa to investigate
allegations of "fraudulent oracles"; in my

16
00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:34.549
later report, I stated that out of five oracles
checked, two were found to be fabricated.

17
00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.459
This resulted in the government relieving
Usa no Ikemori of his position as head priest

18
00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:44.099
and replacing him with the previously-disgraced
Uga no Tamaro.

19
00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:50.639
I appeared on 10-yen notes issued from 1888.
Japan is a fertile land rich with thinkers

20
00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:56.149
and influencers. I hope my reforms had made
my country one of the greatest and enlightened

21
00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.259
nations worldwide.
