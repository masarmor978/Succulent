00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:10.640
I am Fuku Saito, also known as Lady Kasuga. 
Born in 1579 in Tanba, current day Kyoto. I  

2
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.480
was a Japanese noble lady and politician from a 
prominent Japanese samurai family of the Azuchi  

3
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:24.000
Momoyama and Edo periods. I was the wet nurse 
of the third Tokugawa shogun Iemitsu. Scholars  

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.320
consider me as one of the best politicians in 
the Edo period. I stood in front of negotiations  

5
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.280
with the Imperial Court and contributed to 
the stabilization of the Tokugawa Shogunate. 

6
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.400
My birth family, the Saito clan, was a prestigious 
warrior house that had served for generations as  

7
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.520
deputy military governors of Mino province. My 
clan fought with Mitsuhide against Nobunaga.  

8
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.400
A war that my father paid his life for. I was 
later raised by an aristocrat called Kinkuni  

9
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.480
SANJONISHI. I was taught the arts of 
calligraphy, waka poetry, and incense mixing.  

10
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.640
I married Masanari who aided the victory of the 
Tokugawa shogunate. I later became the wet nurse  

11
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.240
of the legitimate son and heir of the second 
shogun, Hidetada TOKUGAWA. It is said that my  

12
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.800
excellent pedigree, aristocratic upbringing, and 
my ex-husband Masanari's military exploits were  

13
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.200
all positive factors in my selection as wet nurse.
I later became a full member of the aristocratic  

14
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.720
Sanjonishi family. This allowed me to 
have an audience with Emperor Gomizunoo,  

15
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.160
and was subsequently awarded the name lady 
Kasuga and given the Junior Third Rank at court,  

16
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.840
and moreover was honored with sake given by the 
emperor. I was later promoted to junior second  

17
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:54.240
rank. I also established the women's quarters at 
Edo Castle. In 1607, after Iemitsu became shōgun,  

18
00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.520
i became the senior ladyship. During my lifetime, 
I had a fortune equivalent to over 100,000 koku. 

19
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:10.400
I died in 1643 and my grave is in a temple in 
Bunkyo, Tokyo. The Kasuga neighborhood of Bunkyo  

20
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.400
takes its name from me. During my life, I 
had formed numerous alliances with powerful  

21
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.320
families and clans, introducing skilled people 
to elites, helping many influencing people  

22
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.080
rise to power and stabilizing the rule of the 
shogunate during hard times. I hope this still  

23
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.840
yields fruitfully and people still believe in the 
power of connections and rightful empowerment.
