00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:09.840
I am Plato. Born in 427 in Athens, Greece. 
I was a Classical Greek philosopher and  

2
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.240
founder of the Academy of Athens, the 
first university of the western world.  

3
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.400
Along with my teacher, Socrates and my student 
Aristotle, I have set the grounds for Western  

4
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.000
philosophy and influenced the thinking of 
many modern philosophers. My extant work is  

5
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.280
in the form of epistles and dialogues, divided 
according to the probable order of composition.  

6
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.560
The Socratic dialogues, the Apology, Meno, 
and Gorgias, present Socrates in conversations  

7
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.840
that illustrate my major ideas about the unity of 
virtue and knowledge and of virtue and happiness.  

8
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.880
They also contain my moving account of 
the last days and death of Socrates.My  

9
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.880
goal in dialogues of the middle years was to 
show the rational relationship between the soul,  

10
00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.320
the state, and the cosmos. The later 
dialogues contain treatises on law,  

11
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.040
mathematics, technical philosophical problems, 
and natural science.I regarded the rational soul  

12
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.480
as immortal, and I believed in a world soul and 
a Demiurge, the creator of the physical world.  

13
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.520
I argued for the independent reality of Ideas, or 
Forms, as the immutable archetypes of all temporal  

14
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.640
phenomena and as the only guarantee of ethical 
standards and of objective scientific knowledge.  

15
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.120
Virtue consists in the harmony of the human soul 
with the universe of Ideas, which assure order,  

16
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.920
intelligence, and pattern to a world in constant 
flux. Supreme among them is the Idea of the Good,  

17
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.320
analogous to the sun in the physical world.Only 
the philosopher, who understands the harmony of  

18
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.160
all parts of the universe with the Idea of the 
Good, can rule the just state. In my various  

19
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.080
dialogues I touched upon virtually every problem 
that has occupied subsequent philosophers; my  

20
00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.600
teachings have been among the most influential in 
the history of Western civilization, and my works  

21
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.920
are counted among the world's finest literature.Be 
kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder  

22
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.520
battle. Listen to others as Every heart 
sings a song, incomplete, until another  

23
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.383
heart whispers back. I hope my studies have 
enlightened the world and inspired many minds.
