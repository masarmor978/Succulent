00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:10.560
I am Haile Selassie. Born in 1892 in Ejersa&nbsp;
Goro, Ethiopia. I was the emperor of Ethiopia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.680
whose influence as an African leader far&nbsp;
surpassed the confines of my country.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.160
I am the nephew of Emperor Menilek II. I spent&nbsp;
my youth at the imperial court of Addis Ababa,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.720
where I learned much about the exercise of power.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.560
The emperor no doubt recognized my capacity&nbsp;
for hard work and my mastery of detail when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.000
he appointed me, at the age of 20, as the&nbsp;
commander of the extensive province of Sidamo.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.520
When Emperor Menilek died, his grandson,&nbsp;
Yasu, succeeded to the throne. Yasu's apparent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.080
conversion to Islam gave impetus to the opposition&nbsp;
movement that I led in deposing Yasu in 1916.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.280
The daughter of emperor Menilek became&nbsp;
empress, and I became heir to the throne.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.080
After the empress' death, I&nbsp;
became the new Ethiopian emperor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.000
I attempted thoroughly to modernize Ethiopia, but&nbsp;
my efforts were cut short when Mussolini's Italy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.240
invaded the country in 1935. The ensuing&nbsp;
Fascist occupation marked the first loss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.920
of national independence in recorded Ethiopian&nbsp;
history. In 1936 I went into exile in England.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.640
In early 1941 British expeditionary forces,&nbsp;
aided by the heroic Ethiopian resistance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.080
liberated the country. Throughout the&nbsp;
next decade, I rebuilt the administration,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.600
improved the army, passed legislation to regulate&nbsp;
the government, church, and financial system.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.200
The next decade involved an uneasy coalition&nbsp;
of conservative and reforming forces.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.320
I continued to hold the political balance&nbsp;
between several major politicians and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.840
recurrent frustration of many reformists&nbsp;
that eventually led to a failed coup in 1960.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.000
In 1963, the newly founded Organization of African&nbsp;
Unity established its headquarters in Addis Ababa,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.120
and I became increasingly&nbsp;
involved with foreign affairs.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.240
A famine in Wello province&nbsp;
forced me to abdicate in 1974&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.560
and I died the next year. Always be yourself,&nbsp;
express yourself, have faith in yourself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.600
do not go out and look for a successful&nbsp;
personality and duplicate it. I worked to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.957
make Ethiopia a torch of hope and prosperity&nbsp;
and I pray it is shining brighter every day.
