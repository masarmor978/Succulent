00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.480
I am Taras Shevchenko. born&nbsp;
in 1814, Morintsy, Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:15.360
I am the foremost Ukrainian poet, prose writer,&nbsp;
painter, and playwright of the 19th century. I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.840
a major figure in the Ukrainian national revival.
I am known for being a man of universal talent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.680
All my life and creative work were&nbsp;
dedicated to the people of Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.520
I dreamed about the times when my country would&nbsp;
be a free sovereign state, where the Ukrainian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.640
language, culture, and history would be highly&nbsp;
valued, and the people would be happy and free.&nbsp;

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.840
Born a serf, I was freed in 1838 while a student&nbsp;
at the St. Petersburg Academy of Fine Arts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.440
My first collection of poems, entitled&nbsp;
Kobzar, expressed the historicism and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.800
the folkloristic interests of the Ukrainian&nbsp;
Romantics, but my poetry soon moved away from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.520
nostalgia for Cossackâ€™s life to a more&nbsp;
somber portrayal of Ukrainian history,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.600
particularly in the long poem "Haidamaks".
I taught visual arts at Kyiv University and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.720
engaged in national activities and writing&nbsp;
the poems such as, "Dream," "Caucasus," and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.000
"Epistle," which satirized the oppression of&nbsp;
Ukraine by Russia and prophesied a revolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.360
This led to my exile by Russian authorities&nbsp;
and compulsory military service.&nbsp;

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.640
Though forbidden to write or paint, I&nbsp;
clandestinely wrote a few lyrical poems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.520
during the first years of my exile. I had a&nbsp;
revival of creativity after my release in 1857.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.080
Later, my poems started treating historical&nbsp;
and moral issues, both Ukrainian and universal.&nbsp;

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.200
I was allowed to return from exile and managed&nbsp;
to come to Ukraine in 1859, yet I was refused&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.520
the right to live in my homeland permanently&nbsp;
and was forced to return to Petersburg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.320
My health had worsened during my ten-year-long&nbsp;
exile, leading to my death in early 1861.&nbsp;

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.480
My name is well-known in the world - monuments&nbsp;
of me were erected in numerous countries,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.880
and my literary works were translated&nbsp;
into almost all languages of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.334
I hope people still believe that words and art&nbsp;
will eventually or later outlive guns and wounds.
