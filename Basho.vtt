00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.560
I am Matsuo Basho from Iga City, Mie prefecture. 
I was born at the beginning of the Edo period in  

2
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.880
1644. I served a Todo Shinshichiro who was a 
samurai general in charge of the Iga region.  

3
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.040
During this period, I came into contact and grew 
fond of haikai which is short form of poetry. 

4
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.880
I broke from the service of the samurai 
family and this awoke me to the freedom  

5
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.920
of the haikai world as i set out on 
my new journey. At the age of 28,  

6
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.680
I compiled an anthology of verses in 
a book entitled the Shell Matching. 

7
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.880
Later, I left for Edo, present-day 
Tokyo, and evolved my own haikai style.  

8
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.800
That is known by scholar as a style 
truly touches the hearts of all people,  

9
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.760
regardless of era. which began to 
reveal an entirely new world of haikai. 

10
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.240
I began with the journey described in a journal 
called Records of the Weather-Exposed Skeleton  

11
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.160
in 1684, followed by others, such as the 
Visit to the Kashima Shrine and the Records  

12
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:15.680
of a Travel-Worn Satchel. In 1689, I left to 
the northern provinces of Honshu. It is this  

13
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.640
experience that provided material for my famous 
work named The Narrow Road to the Deep North.  

14
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.960
This experience made me think in 
more philosophical terms about life,  

15
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.840
travel and poetry. The Narrow Road 
to the Deep North ended in Ogaki,  

16
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.920
Gifu prefecture, after which I 
returned to my beloved home in Iga.  

17
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.880
Three years later I set my mind once more on 
traveling, and set out for Kyushu. However,  

18
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:50.000
i became ill on the way, and died in Osaka on 
1694at the age of 50. I hope my writings have  

19
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.840
touched many hearts, and for you I say Every day 
is a journey, and the journey itself is home.
