I am Matsuo Basho from Iga City, Mie prefecture.&nbsp;
I was born at the beginning of the Edo period in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.920
1644. I served a Todo Shinshichiro who was a&nbsp;
samurai general in charge of the Iga region.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.240
During this period, I came into contact and grew&nbsp;
fond of haikai which is short form of poetry.&nbsp;

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.680
I broke from the service of the samurai family&nbsp;
and this awoke me to the freedom of the haikai&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.080
world as i set out on my new journey. At the&nbsp;
age of 28, I compiled an anthology of verses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.760
in a book entitled the Shell Matching.
Later, I left for Edo, present-day Tokyo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.680
and evolved my own haikai style. That is known&nbsp;
by scholar as a style truly touches the hearts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.680
of all people, regardless of era. which began&nbsp;
to reveal an entirely new world of haikai.&nbsp;

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.520
I began with the journey described in a journal&nbsp;
called Records of the Weather-Exposed Skeleton in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.080
1684, followed by others, such as the Visit to the&nbsp;
Kashima Shrine and the Records of a Travel-Worn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:12.080
Satchel. In 1689, I left to the northern provinces&nbsp;
of Honshu. It is this experience that provided&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.440
material for my famous work named The Narrow&nbsp;
Road to the Deep North. This experience made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.600
me think in more philosophical terms about life,&nbsp;
travel and poetry. The Narrow Road to the Deep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.280
North ended in Ogaki, Gifu prefecture, after&nbsp;
which I returned to my beloved home in Iga.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.160
Three years later I set my mind once more on&nbsp;
traveling, and set out for Kyushu. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:43.280
i became ill on the way, and died in Osaka on&nbsp;
1694at the age of 50. I hope my writings have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.055
touched many hearts, and for you I say Every day&nbsp;
is a journey, and the journey itself is home.
