I am Viacheslav Chornovil. Born in 1937 in&nbsp;
Yerky, Ukraine. I am a Ukrainian politician&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.280
and Soviet dissident. As a prominent&nbsp;
Ukrainian dissident in the Soviet Union,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.040
I was arrested multiple times in the 1960s,&nbsp;
1970s, and 1980s for my political views.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.120
I was one of the leaders of Rukh,&nbsp;
the People's Movement of Ukraine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.000
and editor-in-chief of the newspaper Chas-Time.&nbsp;
One of the most prominent political figures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.440
of the 1980s and 1990s, I paved the way for&nbsp;
contemporary Ukraine to regain its independence.&nbsp;

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.840
I enrolled in the University of Kyiv&nbsp;
initially at the College of Philology,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.400
but after the first semester transferred to&nbsp;
the College of Journalism. Due to conflict in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.200
the university, I took a break from studying and&nbsp;
went for a construction project in Mariupol for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.240
a blast furnace and later worked for the Kyiv&nbsp;
Komsomolets. I was a member of the Komsomol of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.680
Ukraine. He graduated in 1960 with honors.
I was originally a journalist in newspaper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.160
and television before I was fired and sentenced&nbsp;
to forced labor due to my dissident activism.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.360
I became one of Ukraine's foremost independence&nbsp;
activists and was an early member of the Ukrainian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.520
Helsinki Group. In 1988, I founded the People's&nbsp;
Movement of Ukraine, the first non-communist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.600
party in Ukraine, and ran unsuccessfully&nbsp;
to be the first president of independent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:25.040
Ukraine in 1991, losing to Leonid Kravchuk.
In 1994, I became one of President Leonid Kuchma's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.240
foremost critics. My sudden and mysterious death&nbsp;
in a car accident brought an end to my campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.640
I have been remembered as one of the most&nbsp;
significant figures in Ukraine's regaining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.960
independence in 1991. In my life, I documented&nbsp;
many illegal acts by individuals and governments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.360
alike. My courage was always inspired by my desire&nbsp;
to forge a great nation. I hope I gave an example&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.000
for the next generations to always be firm and&nbsp;
never tolerate their rights to live in dignity.
