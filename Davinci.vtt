00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.640
I am Leonardo da Vinci, born in 
1452 near the Tuscan town of Vinci,  

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.880
Italy. I was one of the great creative minds 
of the Italian Renaissance, hugely influential  

3
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.320
as an artist and sculptor but also immensely 
talented as an engineer, scientist and inventor. 

4
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.720
I was apprenticed to painter Andrea del 
Verrocchio in Florence and in 1478 became  

5
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:34.000
an independent master. In about 1483, I moved to 
Milan to work for the ruling Sforza family as a  

6
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.680
sculptor and an architect. I produced a mural 
of 'The Last Supper' in the refectory of the  

7
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.000
Monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie, Milan.
I was in Milan until the city was invaded  

8
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.400
by the French in 1499 and the Sforza family 
forced to flee. I returned to Florence where  

9
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.240
I painted several portraits, but the only 
one that survives is the famous Mona Lisa. 

10
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.520
The fame of my surviving paintings has meant that 
I have been regarded primarily as an artist, but  

11
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.880
the thousands of surviving pages of my notebooks 
reveal the most eclectic and brilliant of minds.  

12
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.600
I wrote and drew on subjects including geology, 
flight, gravity, optics and anatomy which I  

13
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.560
studied to paint the human form more accurately. 
I 'invented' the bicycle, airplane, helicopter,  

14
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.000
and parachute some 500 years ahead of their time.
In 1517, at the invitation of the French king  

15
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.160
Francis I, I moved to the Château of Cloux, near 
Amboise in France, where I died on 2 May 1519. 

16
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.160
If all this work had been published in an 
intelligible form, my place as a pioneering  

17
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.560
scientist would have been beyond dispute. Yet my 
true genius was not as a scientist or an artist,  

18
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.400
but as a combination of the two: an 
'artist-engineer'. My painting was scientific,  

19
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.440
based on a deep understanding of the workings of 
the human body and the physics of light and shade.  

20
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.120
My science was expressed through art, and 
my drawings and diagrams show what I meant,  

21
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:16.640
and I hope this influenced the 
world to be a better place.
