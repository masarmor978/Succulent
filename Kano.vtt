00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:10.590
I am Kano Jigoro. born in “1860” in Kobe
prefecture. I am the founder of Judo popular

2
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.790
as Kodokan judo. Judo was the first Japanese
martial art to gain widespread international

3
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:23.140
recognition, and the first to become an official
Olympic sport. Pedagogical innovations attributed

4
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.070
to me include the use of black and white belts,
and the introduction of dan ranking to show

5
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.790
the relative ranking between members of a
martial art style.

6
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.240
I began practicing jujutsu as a way to strengthen
my frail body at early age. I studied both

7
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:47.230
the Tenjin Shinyo-ryu and Kito-ryu styles
of classical jujutsu. I mastered these styles,

8
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.720
and supplemented this training with an avid
interest in other combative forms. I integrated

9
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.280
what I considered the positive points of these
with my own ideas and inspirations. I transformed

10
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.009
the traditional jujutsu principle of "Defeating
strength through flexibility" into a new principle

11
00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.900
of "Maximum efficient use of physical and
mental energy". The result was a new theoretical

12
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.240
and technical system that I felt better matched
the needs of modern people.

13
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.470
In my professional life, I was an educator,
serving as director of primary education for

14
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.810
the Ministry of Education and as president
of Tokyo Higher Normal School. I played a

15
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.800
key role in making judo and kendo part of
the Japanese public-school programs of the

16
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.560
year “1910”.

17
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.619
I was also a pioneer of international sports
and the first Asian member of the International

18
00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.380
Olympic Committee. I represented Japan at
most Olympic Games held between “1912”

19
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.689
and “1936”; and served as a leading spokesman
for Japan's bid for the “1940” Olympic

20
00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.250
Games.

21
00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.950
I died in “1938” at age “77”. I was
honored with the First Order of Merit and

22
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.060
Grand Order of the Rising Sun and the Third
Imperial Degree. I was inducted into the International

23
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.799
Judo Federation Hall of Fame in “1999”.
The International Judo Federation includes

24
00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:20.159
representatives from “195” countries and
regions. I turned the art of self-protection

25
00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:25.900
to Judo which is the art of self-perfection.
I hope my heritage will encourage many people

26
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.170
to sharpen their souls as much as they sharpen
their bodies.
