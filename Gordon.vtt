00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.080
I am George William Gordon born in&nbsp;
1820 in Mavis Bank, Jamaica. I was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.400
Jamaican businessman and politician who was a&nbsp;
critic of the British policies in my country.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.040
I was executed due to my opinions which&nbsp;
created a huge controversy in Britain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.400
and I was proclaimed a National Hero of Jamaica.
 
My father is a Scottish Planter and attorney to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.960
several sugar estates in Jamaica. I went to&nbsp;
live with my godfather in Black River and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.240
completed my education there. Within a year,&nbsp;
I began working in my grandfatherâ€™s business.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.680
I became a large landowner,&nbsp;
shopkeeper, produce dealer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.640
preacher, social worker, and philanthropist.
 
In the face of attempts to crush the spirit of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.200
the freed people of Jamaica and again reduce&nbsp;
them to slavery, I entered politics and faced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.440
severe odds, as the people whose interests&nbsp;
I sought to serve did not qualify to vote.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.720
I subdivided my own lands, selling farm&nbsp;
lots to the people as cheaply as possible,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.800
and organized a marketing system, through which&nbsp;
they could sell their produce at fair prices.
 &nbsp;

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.720
My public life began about 1844 when I entered&nbsp;
politics as an advocate for the poverty-stricken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.720
African-enslaved peasants. In 1865, the&nbsp;
economic condition in Jamaica had gotten worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.600
I spoke openly on behalf of the poor Africans&nbsp;
and with bitter criticism of the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.240
During this period of oppression,&nbsp;
the Morant Bay rebellion broke out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.480
It was led by Paul Bogle, an activist in&nbsp;
revolting against the system of government.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.400
They raided a police station for arms&nbsp;
and the Court House in Morant Bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.680
It was from this incident that a warrant was&nbsp;
done for my arrest. As soon as I knew it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.520
I turned myself in to authorities. Despite&nbsp;
lack of evidence, I was executed in 1865.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.320
In the aftermath of the labor rebellion, I&nbsp;
came to be seen as a precursor of Jamaican&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.440
nationalism and was given the nation's highest&nbsp;
honor, Order of National Hero. I lived giving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.440
whatever I had for the less fortunate wishing&nbsp;
for a ripple effect that will spread all over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.489
the world.
