00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:10.250
I am Okuma Shigenobu from Saga prefecture,
born in “1838” Saga, I twice served as

2
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.620
prime minister of Japan in “1898” and
“1914”.

3
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.529
I organized the Progressive Party and founded
Waseda University.

4
00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.940
After receiving a conventional education,
I turned to Western studies and took learning

5
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:26.940
English.

6
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.410
Following the Meiji Restoration in “1868”,
which reestablished the formal ruling authority

7
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.410
of the emperor, leaders of the Meiji government
broadened their base of support by adding

8
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.410
representation from my Saga domain.

9
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.670
My ability and courage soon brought me an
important role in government, at first specializing

10
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.670
in finance.

11
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.530
From “1869” to “1881” I was chiefly
responsible for modernizing and reorganizing

12
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.979
Japan’s fiscal system.

13
00:00:45.979 --> 00:01:02.399
I proposed running elections as soon as possible,
encouraged convening a parliament, and the

14
00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.400
British system of a cabinet responsible to
parliament be established.

15
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.670
My opinions and actions forced me out of the
government, but the movement for a constitution

16
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.700
gained great impetus.

17
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.469
In response to popular pressure, the emperor
promised that a constitution would be readied

18
00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:19.649
by “1890”.

19
00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.079
The document was completed and promulgated
a year earlier.

20
00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:29.579
I formed a political party called the Kaishinto,
that was oriented toward English parliamentary

21
00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.630
concepts.

22
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:38.640
Earlier, in 1882, I had founded in Tokyo what
soon after became known as Waseda University,

23
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.329
one of the two leading private universities
in Japan.

24
00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.509
I retired from politics in 1907 to devote
all my time to Waseda, only to be recalled

25
00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.640
as prime minister in 1914.

26
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.719
During that term Japan experienced a great
economic boom, partly as a result of the increased

27
00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.170
trade brought by World War I.

28
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.310
In “1916” I, by then in ill health, resigned
and retired from politics.

29
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.159
I later returned to Waseda, and died there
in “1922”.

30
00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.249
An estimated 300,000 people attended my funeral
in Tokyo's Hibiya Park.

31
00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:08.249
I was posthumously conferred with the Collar
of the Order of the Chrysanthemum, the nation's

32
00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:09.249
highest honor.

33
00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:10.249
I was buried at the temple of Gokoku-ji in
Tokyo.

34
00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:34.390
I believed Life is like a flowing river.

35
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.390
Youth is the source of the river and old age
is downstream.

36
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.430
I hope Japan has become a big and strong river
sending the world to unprecedented prosperity.
