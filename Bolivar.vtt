00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.040
I am Simón Bolívar, born in 1783 in 
Caracas, New Granada, current day Venezuela.  

2
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.920
I am Venezuelan military leader who was 
instrumental in the revolutions against  

3
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.880
the Spanish empire. I became involved in the 
resistance movement and played a key role in  

4
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.320
the Spanish American fight for independence. 
Being an inspirational leader and contributor  

5
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.080
to the freedom of Latin American citizens, 
the "Republic of Bolivia" was named after me. 

6
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.960
I was born into a prosperous family who took their 
money from rich gold and copper mines they owned  

7
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.880
in Venezuela. I moved to Spain to complete 
my education at age 16. I found the Spanish  

8
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.360
government in the Americas very tyrannical. When 
Napoleon invaded Spain in 1808, I was in Caracas  

9
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.920
and joined the resistance movement to liberate 
Venezuela and most of South American regions. 

10
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.000
In 1813 we formed the Venezuelan Second Republic 
after years of fighting and I was called  

11
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.280
the Liberator by the people. However, 
civil war soon erupted in the republic,  

12
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.560
forcing me to flee to Jamaica where I wrote my 
famous "Letter from Jamaica". In it I detailed  

13
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.040
my vision of a South American republic with 
a parliamentary setup modeled after England. 

14
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.640
Gaining support from Haiti, I returned to my 
home continent and became involved in several  

15
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.920
military battles, eventually able to claim several 
territories. 1821 saw the creation of a federation  

16
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.360
included much of what is now Venezuela, Colombia, 
Panama, and Ecuador, under my leadership.  

17
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.880
Later I become the leader of Peru in 1824, 
followed by the creation of Bolivia in 1825. 

18
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.080
I had succeeded in uniting much of South America 
in a federation free from Spanish control,  

19
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.000
but the government was fragile. 
I faced opposition from internal  

20
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.760
factions and escaped an assassination attempt. 
I suffered from tuberculosis and died in 1830 

21
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.600
I planted the freedom seed in south America and 
wished see civilization bloom on the wealthy land.  

22
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.640
My legacy can be seen in the multitude 
of statues and plaza squares bearing my  

23
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:18.640
likeness all over the world. I hope my heritage 
lives to this day among people minds and hearts.
