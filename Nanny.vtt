00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:10.320
I am Queen Nanny, born in 1686 in Ghana, West&nbsp;
Africa. I was a leader of the Maroons who are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.600
descendants of Africans in the Americas,&nbsp;
mainly people from the Akan. I am known&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.280
as an outstanding military leader against the&nbsp;
British in Jamaica. In my lifetime and after,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.520
I become a symbol of unity and strength&nbsp;
for my people during times of crisis.
 &nbsp;

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.440
I arrived in Jamaica as a free woman from&nbsp;
Africa. I was particularly important to my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.520
people in the fierce fight with the British,&nbsp;
during the First Maroon War from 1720 to 1739.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.920
I was a small, wiry woman with piercing&nbsp;
eyes and exceptional leadership qualities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.760
My influence over the Maroons was so strong&nbsp;
aided with the powers of ancient spirits. I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.640
particularly skilled in organizing the guerilla&nbsp;
warfare and traps that confused the British.
 &nbsp;

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.640
Besides inspiring my people to ward off the&nbsp;
troops, I was also a type of wise woman of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.320
village, who passed down legends and encouraged&nbsp;
the continuation of customs, music and songs that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.000
had come with the people from Africa, and which&nbsp;
instilled in them confidence and pride. My spirit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.920
of freedom was so great that in 1739, when the&nbsp;
Jamaican co-leader signed the second Treaty with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.040
the British, I was very angry and in disagreement&nbsp;
with the principle of peace with the British,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.040
which I knew meant another form of subjugation.
 
There are many legends about me among the Maroons.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.000
But all the legends and documents refer to&nbsp;
me, as a courageous and inspiring leader who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.400
struggled to maintain the spirit of freedom,&nbsp;
and life of independence, which was their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.320
rightful inheritance. I am the only woman to be&nbsp;
bestowed the Order of National Hero in Jamaica.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.560
I stand as a reminder for all Jamaican women to&nbsp;
be brave when faced with adversity, injustice, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.846
oppression. When they ask why Jamaican are feisty,&nbsp;
tell them they got it from grandmother Nanny!
