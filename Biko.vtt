I am Steve Biko. Born in 1946 in King William’s&nbsp;
Town, South Africa. I am the founder of the Black&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.560
Consciousness Movement in South Africa.&nbsp;
My death from injuries suffered while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.800
in police custody made me an international&nbsp;
martyr for South African Black nationalism.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.080
After being expelled from high school for&nbsp;
political activism, I enrolled in and graduated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.880
from St. Francis College, a liberal boarding&nbsp;
school in Natal, and then entered the University&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.960
of Natal Medical School. There, I became involved&nbsp;
in the multiracial National Union of South African&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.160
Students or NUSAS, a moderate organization&nbsp;
that had long espoused the rights of Blacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.400
I soon grew disenchanted with NUSAS, believing&nbsp;
that, instead of simply allowing Blacks to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.600
participate in white South African society, the&nbsp;
society itself needed to be restructured around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.680
the culture of the Black majority. In 1968 I&nbsp;
co-founded the all-Black South African Students’&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.800
Organization and I became its first president&nbsp;
the following year. The organization was based&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.120
on the philosophy of Black consciousness, which&nbsp;
encouraged Blacks to recognize their inherent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.960
dignity and self-worth. In the 1970s the Black&nbsp;
Consciousness Movement spread from university&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.040
campuses into urban Black communities throughout&nbsp;
South Africa. In 1972 I was one of the founders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.360
of the Black People’s Convention, an umbrella&nbsp;
organization of Black consciousness groups.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.080
I operated covertly, establishing the Zimele Trust&nbsp;
Fund in 1975 to help political prisoners and their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.520
families. I was arrested and held without trial&nbsp;
for months numerous times. In 1977, I and a fellow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.960
activist were seized at a roadblock and jailed&nbsp;
in Port Elizabeth. I was found naked and shackled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.600
outside a hospital in Pretoria, 1,190 km away, and&nbsp;
died the next day of a massive brain hemorrhage.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.840
Police initially denied any maltreatment&nbsp;
or involvement in my death. In 1997,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.400
five former police officers confessed to having&nbsp;
killed me and applied for amnesty to the Truth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.200
and Reconciliation Commission. It is better to&nbsp;
die for an idea that will live than to live for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.868
an idea that will die. I pray black people can&nbsp;
live with dignity and pride all over the world.
