I am Alexander Graham Bell&nbsp;
born in 1847 in Edinburgh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.880
United Kingdom. I was a Scottish-born&nbsp;
American scientist and inventor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.160
most famous for my pioneering work&nbsp;
on the development of the telephone.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.400
My father and grandfather were both&nbsp;
authorities on elocution and at the age of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.720
16 I began researching the mechanics of speech.&nbsp;
In 1870, I emigrated with my family to Canada,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.440
and the following year I moved to the United&nbsp;
States to teach. There, I pioneered a system&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.040
called visible speech, developed by my&nbsp;
father, to teach deaf-mute children.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.440
In 1872, I founded a school in Boston to train&nbsp;
teachers of the deaf. The school subsequently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.880
became part of Boston University, where I was&nbsp;
appointed professor of vocal physiology in 1873.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.560
I had long been fascinated by the idea of&nbsp;
transmitting speech, and by 1875, had come up with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.680
a simple receiver that could turn electricity into&nbsp;
sound. Others were working along the same lines,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.320
including an Italian-American Antonio Meucci, and&nbsp;
debate continues as to who, should be credited&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.760
with inventing the telephone. However, I was&nbsp;
granted a patent for the telephone in 1876 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.400
it developed quickly. Within a year the first&nbsp;
telephone exchange was built in Connecticut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.200
and the Bell Telephone Company was created in&nbsp;
1877, with me owning a third of the shares.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.560
In 1880, I was awarded the French Volta Prize&nbsp;
for my invention and with the money, founded the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.600
Volta Laboratory in Washington, where I continued&nbsp;
experiments in communication, in medical research,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.440
and in techniques for teaching speech to the&nbsp;
deaf, working with Helen Keller among others.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.480
In 1888, I became one of the founding&nbsp;
members of the National Geographic Society,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.160
and served as its president from 1896 to&nbsp;
1904, also helping to establish its journal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.760
I died in 1922 while spending&nbsp;
my life helping citizens of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.840
world hear each other regardless of the&nbsp;
distance. Concentrate all your thoughts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.684
upon the work in hand. The Sun's rays&nbsp;
do not burn until brought to a focus.
