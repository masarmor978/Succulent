00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.900
I am Vasyl Stus. Born in 1938, in Rakhnivka,&nbsp;
Ukraine. I am a Ukrainian poet, translator,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.340
literary critic, journalist, and active&nbsp;
member of the Ukrainian dissident movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.860
For my political convictions, my works were&nbsp;
banned by the Soviet regime and I spent 13&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.600
years in detention until my death in a Soviet&nbsp;
forced labor camp for political prisoners.&nbsp;

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.180
I am from a peasant family who moved to&nbsp;
Donetsk, Ukraine. I first encountered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.380
the Ukrainian language and poetry from my&nbsp;
mother who sang me Ukrainian folk songs.&nbsp;

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.480
I was enrolled in Donetsk University and&nbsp;
graduated from the Institute with honors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.180
Following graduation, I briefly worked as a high&nbsp;
school teacher of the Ukrainian language before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.640
being conscripted into the Soviet Army for two&nbsp;
years in the Ural Mountains. During this period,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.680
started to write poetry and translated into&nbsp;
Ukrainian more than a hundred verses by Johann&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.260
Wolfgang von Goethe and Rainer Maria Rilke.&nbsp;
The original copies of my translations were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.560
later confiscated by the KGB, and were lost.
After my military service, I worked as an editor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.540
for the Socialist Donbas newspaper and entered&nbsp;
a Doctoral program at the Ukrainian Academy of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.720
Sciences in Kyiv. I took part in a protest against&nbsp;
the arrests of the Ukrainian intelligentsia.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.100
As a result, I was expelled from&nbsp;
the Institute and later lost my job.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.900
I wrote many books that were rejected by&nbsp;
publishers as they contradicted Soviet values&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.900
regardless of positive reviews from the poets and&nbsp;
critics. I was later arrested for "anti-Soviet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.180
agitation and propaganda" and served a five-year&nbsp;
sentence in a labor camp, and a two-year exile.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.240
Prior to the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, I&nbsp;
was arrested and received a 10-year sentence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.060
for "anti-Soviet activity”. When I met with my&nbsp;
appointed lawyer, I immediately felt that he was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.280
a man of an aggressive type, he did not protect&nbsp;
me, and, in fact, was not interested in my case.&nbsp;

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.700
I died after I declared a hunger strike in 1985&nbsp;
with other fellows who wanted freedom for Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.580
I am sure my words have outlived my jailer.
