00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:11.280
I am Otto Eduard Leopold von Bismarck, born in 
Schonhausen, northwest of Berlin, Germany in 1815.  

2
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.160
I transferred a collection of small 
German states into the German empire,  

3
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.120
and I am its first chancellor.
I am from an aristocratic family and so  

4
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.960
was my education at the University of Gottingen. 
I entered the Prussian civil service but later  

5
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:34.160
decided to help managing family affairs until 
1847. That year I began my political career in the  

6
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.360
Prussian legislature, where I gained a reputation 
as an ultra-conservative royalist. In 1851,  

7
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.240
King Frederick Wilhelm appointed me as Prussian 
representative to the German confederation.  

8
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:54.160
I then served as ambassador to Russia and France. 
In 1862, I returned to Prussia and was appointed  

9
00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.160
prime minister by the new king, Wilhelm I.
I was now determined to unite the German  

10
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.480
states into a single empire, with Prussia at 
its core. With Austrian support, I used the  

11
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.480
expanded Prussian army to capture the provinces 
of Schleswig and Holstein from Denmark. I then  

12
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.680
escalated a quarrel with Austria and its German 
allies over the administration of these provinces  

13
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.600
into a war, in which Prussia was the victor.
The southern German states joined with the newly  

14
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.440
formed north German confederation 
after hostilities with France.  

15
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.640
The German victory in the Franco-Prussian War won 
over the southern German states, and in 1871 they  

16
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.200
agreed to join a German empire. Emperor Wilhelm 
assigned me as 'chancellor' of the new Germany,  

17
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.120
I concentrated on building a powerful state 
with a unified national identity. I worked to  

18
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.920
prevent the spread of socialism, partly by 
introducing health insurance and pensions. 

19
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.720
Abroad, I aimed to empower the 
German empire in Europe. In 1879,  

20
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.760
I negotiated an alliance with Austria-Hungary 
and Italy to counteract France and Russia.  

21
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.600
I formed numerous global agreements to 
stabilize German international affairs. 

22
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:17.760
In 1890, I retired to my estate near Hamburg and 
died there in 1898. A great man is known by three  

23
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.080
signs. generosity in the design, humanity 
in the execution, moderation in success.  

24
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:35.680
I hope I have forged a great German nation 
that blooms in justice and prosperity.
