00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.800
I am Abraham Lincoln, born in 1809 in Hodgenville,
Kentucky, in the United States of America.

2
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.280
I was the 16th president of the United States
and one of the great American leaders. My

3
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.050
presidency was dominated by the American Civil
War.

4
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:27.439
My parents were poor pioneers, and I was largely
self-educated. In 1836, I qualified as a lawyer

5
00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.320
and went to work in a law practice in Springfield,
Illinois. I sat in the state legislature from

6
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:41.700
1834 to 1842 and in 1846 was elected to Congress,
representing the Whig Party for a term. In

7
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.280
1856, I joined the new Republican Party and
in 1860 I was asked to run as their presidential

8
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.640
candidate.
In the presidential campaign, I made my opposition

9
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.650
to slavery very clear. My victory provoked
a crisis, with many southerners fearing that

10
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.940
I would attempt to abolish slavery in the
South. Seven southern states left the Union

11
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.369
to form the Confederate States of America,
also known as the Confederacy. Four more joined

12
00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.189
later. I vowed to preserve the Union even
if it meant war.

13
00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.060
Fighting broke out in 1861. I always defined
the Civil War as a struggle to save the Union,

14
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.480
but in 1863 I nonetheless issued the Emancipation
Proclamation, which freed all slaves in areas

15
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.090
still under Confederate control. This was
an important symbolic gesture that identified

16
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.469
the Union's struggle as a war to end slavery.
Later that year, I delivered the famous Gettysburg

17
00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:44.549
Address at the dedication of a cemetery at
the site of the Battle of Gettysburg, a decisive

18
00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.639
Union victory that had taken place earlier
in the year.

19
00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:55.509
In 1864, I stood for re-election and won and
was conciliatory towards the southern states.

20
00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:02.060
One year later the civil war ended costing
the lives of 600,000. Less than a week later,

21
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.859
I was shot while attending a performance at
Ford's Theatre in Washington DC and died the

22
00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:13.920
next morning. My assassin, John Wilkes Booth,
was a strong supporter of the Confederacy.

23
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.480
I am a slow walker, but I never walk back.
I hope this is still the way the United States

24
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.250
is leading the world.
