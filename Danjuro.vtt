00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.480
I am Ichikawa Danjuro the seventh, born 
in “1791” in Edo, Current day Tokyo.  

2
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.800
I was a Japanese kabuki actor who specialized 
in male hero roles, said to be the greatest  

3
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.400
of the 19th century. I was responsible for 
the establishment of the Kabuki Juhachiban,  

4
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.600
a collection of the eighteen greatest plays in the 
repertoire. I also played Kanjinchō that is kabuki  

5
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.840
dance-drama based on the Noh play Ataka.
In the early “1810s”, I performed at the  

6
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.520
Ichimura-za in a number of new plays by the 
great playwright Tsuruya Nanboku, and played  

7
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.080
the titular role of Sukeroku in Sukeroku Yukari 
no Edo Zakura for the first time in “1811”.  

8
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.480
The famous onnagata Segawa Kikunojo remained 
my chief partners onstage throughout until  

9
00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.920
“1840”. I played the role of Benkei in the “1840” 
premiere of Kanjinchō at the Kawarazaki-za. 

10
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.320
Benkei was a Japanese warrior monk who lived in 
“794”. He was commonly depicted as a man of great  

11
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.320
strength and loyalty, and a popular subject of 
Japanese folklore, showcased in many ancient and  

12
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.080
modern literature and productions. The play 
ends with Benkei performing a special Kabuki  

13
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.160
technique for leaving the scene, called Tobiroppō, 
jumping on a long raised platform, running through  

14
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:35.280
the audience, connecting to the main stage.
At a performance at the Nakamura-za in “1859”,  

15
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.120
I began to feel ill, and left the stage for 
several weeks. I was scheduled to perform as  

16
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:48.160
Soga no Iruka, but fell ill once more and died 
on the same year. To this day the name Ichikawa  

17
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.360
Danjuro is being held by actors who perform 
roles that resemble the loyalty and determination  

18
00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.560
to serve our masters. I hope my heritage is 
alive to this day in people minds and hearts.
