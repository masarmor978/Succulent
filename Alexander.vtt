00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.960
I am Alexander III of Macedon, better known as 
Alexander the Great. Single-handedly changed  

2
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.840
the nature of the ancient world in little 
more than a decade. I was born in Pella,  

3
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:22.160
the ancient capital of Macedonia in July 356 BC.
My parents were Philip II of Macedon and Olympias.  

4
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.240
I was educated by the philosopher Aristotle. 
My father was assassinated in 336 BC,  

5
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.440
and I inherited a powerful yet volatile kingdom. 
I quickly dealt with my enemies at home and  

6
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.440
reasserted Macedonian power within Greece. I then 
set out to conquer the massive Persian Empire. 

7
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.480
Against overwhelming odds, I led my 
army to victories across the Persian  

8
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.040
territories of Asia Minor, Syria, and 
Egypt without suffering a single defeat.  

9
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.000
My greatest victory was at the Battle of 
Gaugamela, in what is now northern Iraq,  

10
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.840
in 331 BC. Beside being the young king 
of Macedonia, leader of the Greeks,  

11
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.600
overlord of Asia Minor and pharaoh of Egypt, I 
became 'great king' of Persia at the age of 25. 

12
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.960
Over the next eight years, in my capacity as 
king, commander, politician, scholar and explorer,  

13
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.000
I led my army a further 11,000 miles, 
founding over 70 cities and creating an  

14
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.400
empire that stretched across three continents 
and covered around two million square miles.  

15
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.880
The entire area from Greece in 
the west, north to the Danube,  

16
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.920
south into Egypt and as far to the east as the 
Indian Punjab, was linked together in a vast  

17
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.920
international network of trade and commerce. This 
was united by a common Greek language and culture,  

18
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.240
while I adopted foreign customs to rule the 
millions of ethnically diverse subjects. 

19
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.760
My army only refused to follow me once in 
13 years of a reign during which there was  

20
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.880
constant fighting. This indicates the loyalty I 
inspired. I died of fever in Babylon in 323 BC.  

21
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.280
I am indebted to my father for living, 
but to my teacher for living well.  

22
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.520
They taught me everything I needed to 
unite the old world and I hope the new  

23
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.840
world is flourishing with those who teach 
inspiration to humans across the world.
