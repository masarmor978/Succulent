00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:11.040
I am Igor Sikorsky, born in 1889 in Kyiv. Ukraine,&nbsp;
I pioneered in aircraft design and am best known&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.600
for my successful development of the helicopter.
My father was a professor of psychology. My mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.800
great interest in the work of Leonardo da Vinci&nbsp;
stimulated my early interest in experimenting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.520
with model flying machines. I enrolled in the&nbsp;
Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. I noticed abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.320
sciences and the higher mathematics taught had&nbsp;
little relationship to the solution of practical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.600
problems, and left the school, preferring&nbsp;
to spend time in my own shop and laboratory.&nbsp;

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.880
My trips to Europe allowed me to be in contact&nbsp;
with the accomplishments of the Wright brothers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.320
and European inventors. Later in Kyiv,&nbsp;
I began the construction of a helicopter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.120
facing many challenges with engine designs and&nbsp;
state-of-the-art technologies of that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.880
It was then that I decided to enter the field&nbsp;
of fixed-wing design and began construction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:07.520
of his first airplane. My S series biplane&nbsp;
was tested early in 1910 and after one year,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.400
my S-5 remained in the air for more than an hour,&nbsp;
and attain altitudes of 450 meters, earning me the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.000
International Pilot’s License Number 64.
In the period of disruption following the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.200
Russian Revolution and the collapse of Germany,&nbsp;
I saw little opportunity for further aircraft&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.200
development in Europe. I decided to start&nbsp;
over again in the United States in 1919.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.440
My S series developments resumed with well-trained&nbsp;
engineers and a growing passion. In 1931 the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.960
S-40, the “American Clipper,” pioneered Pan&nbsp;
American World Airways mail and passenger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.680
routes around the Caribbean and to South America.
Early in 1939, I started the construction of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.160
VS-300 helicopter. It took my dream&nbsp;
30 years to come to life. Certainly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.000
I expected my innovations to be used to rescue and&nbsp;
relieve human beings caught in natural disasters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.840
I received many honorary doctorates in science&nbsp;
and engineering and honorary fellowships in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.160
leading scientific societies all over the world.&nbsp;
I remained active in consultation until my death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.837
in 1972. Our dreams will bloom at the right&nbsp;
time if we feed them with belief and passion.
