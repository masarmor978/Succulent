00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.600
I am Joséde San Martín born in 1778 in Yapeyu,  

2
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.720
current day Argentina. I am soldier and 
statesman who played an important role  

3
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.560
in winning the independence of several 
South American countries from Spain. 

4
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.880
At the age of 7, I returned to Spain with my 
parents and entered the Royal Academy as a cadet  

5
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.640
and was educated there with sons of the nobility 
of Spain. I acquired the rank of lieutenant  

6
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.360
colonel after fighting in some campaigns 
against French forces in the Peninsular War. 

7
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.240
Hearing of the revolt against Spain in Argentina, 
I resigned from the army in 1812 and sailed for  

8
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.640
Buenos Aires to join the patriot forces. I took 
a prominent part in organizing Argentine troops  

9
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.280
and soon became military governor of the 
north to organize defense in Upper Peru.  

10
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.400
I spent 3 years in the Andes recruiting 
and training my army to dislodge the  

11
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.880
Spanish forces from Chile, Peru, and Bolivia.
We took the Spanish army by surprise in Chile  

12
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:10.320
in 1817 and made Chile completely free of Spanish 
troops. I assembled a fleet which, under the able  

13
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.280
command of Lord Cochrane, swept Spanish shipping 
from the west coast of South America. In 1820,  

14
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.840
my army was transported toward Peru. 1 year later, 
my forces proclaimed the independence of Peru. 

15
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.360
Since Spanish army had merely withdrawn into 
the mountains and was still a viable fighting  

16
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.560
force and a threat. I did not have enough force 
to meet the Spaniards and would need the aid  

17
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.320
of the armies of another liberator, Bolívar, 
who had just liberated the areas of Venezuela,  

18
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.320
Colombia, and Ecuador.
We met at Guayaquil which is  

19
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.320
marked as one of the most disputed points in South 
American history. I preferred a constitutional  

20
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.240
monarchy while Bolívar believed in complete 
democracy. That disagreement led to resigning all  

21
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.240
my power in Peru to the congress and leaving for 
Argentina and then to France where I died in 1850. 

22
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.560
The soldiers of our land know no luxury, 
but glory. My men and I fought fearlessly  

23
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.200
for freedom and rights that I hope 
people are blessed with to this day.
