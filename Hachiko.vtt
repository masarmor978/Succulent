00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.240
I am Eizaburo Ueno, a professor in 
agriculture science at Tokyo University.  

2
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:23.280
I was born in 1872. I had looked for the perfect 
Akita puppy for a long time, until one of my  

3
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.880
students encouraged me to adopt Hachiko, my 
loyal dog from Akita prefecture of Japan.  

4
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.600
As Hachiko grew older, he started to see me off to 
work in the morning at the Shibuya Train Station,  

5
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.600
in central Tokyo and went to pick me up 
at the station in the afternoon when i  

6
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.720
returned from work. On May 21, 1925, 
only two years after Hachiko was born,  

7
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.800
Hachiko was as usually sitting by the exit at 
Shibuya train station waiting for me. But I never  

8
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.560
showed up. I suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage 
and died suddenly and unexpectedly while at work.  

9
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.800
Hachiko moved in with a former 
gardener of the Ueno family.  

10
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.240
But throughout the rest of his ten-year-long 
life, he kept going to the Shibuya Train  

11
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.800
Station every morning and afternoon precisely 
when the train was due to enter the station.  

12
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.960
He sat there for hours, patiently waiting in vain 
for the return of me which sadly never came back.  

13
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.280
In 1935, Hachiko passed away peacefully 
and alone on the street near Shibuya  

14
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.440
train station and still represents the 
warmest and most loyal bond between  

15
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.840
humans and dogs. Loyalty is not easy but it is 
rewarding, let Hachiko vibe live among us all.
