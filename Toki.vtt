1
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.180
I am a Monument called: We-Will-Never-Forget-The-Time.

2
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.940
I Stand in Ueno Park as a memory for victims
of the World War II Tokyo air raids.

3
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.830
It targeted military factories and civilian
population of the city that happened in 1945.

4
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.170
I was built by Yohei Ebina who lost his own
family during the raid.

5
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.340
I resemble his family and many other innocent
civilians who died during the bombing.

6
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.480
There is clock tower above me that will remind
people of the importance of the peaceful times.

7
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.760
Tokyo raid was part of an Operation named
Meeting-house, which was conducted on the

8
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.211
night of 9th and 10th of March 1945, it is
the single most destructive bombing raid in

9
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.990
human history.

10
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.600
It aimed at central Tokyo and 16 square miles
or 41 square kilometers were destroyed, leaving

11
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.010
an estimated 100,000 civilians dead and over
one million homeless.

12
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.899
It was devastating times in which 1,665 tons
of cluster bombs filled with Napalm, jelled-gasoline

13
00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:10.439
and white phosphorus were dropped by 339 B29
bombers.

14
00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.649
Tokyo was not the only Japanese city that
suffered from such attacks but it clearly

15
00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.030
it received the deadliest one.

16
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.240
This is because many of the work force who
served in critical war industries lived and

17
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.700
worked in here.

18
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.479
Emperor Hirohito's tour of the destroyed areas
of Tokyo in March 1945 was the beginning of

19
00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.569
his personal involvement in the peace process,
culminating in Japan's surrender six months

20
00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:35.249
later.

21
00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:39.240
The future belongs to those who believe in
the beauty of their dreams.

22
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.549
We in Tokyo believed so and started to rebuild
our city like other cities in Japan on a foundation

23
00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.439
of loving peace and life.

24
00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.750
A thousand paper cranes were turned regularly
beside me to remind the visitors and the world

25
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.820
with the importance of peace and to never
let it go.

26
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.109
I hope the innocent souls all over the world
are not used as fuel for the wars anymore.
