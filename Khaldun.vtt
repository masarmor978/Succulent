00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:11.389
I am Abd al-Rahman ibn Khaldun born in 1332
in current day Tunisia. I was an Arab historian,

2
00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.650
philosopher, and statesman whose treatise,
the Muqaddima, in which I pioneered a general

3
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.740
sociological theory of history. Scholars consider
me as one of the most original thinkers of

4
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.460
the Middle Ages.
My family are of southern Arabian origin.

5
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.090
They settled in Seville, current day Spain
and were distinguished as the political and

6
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.670
intellectuals of the city. Shortly before
the Christian reconquest we left and eventually

7
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.899
settled in Tunis. I always felt attached to
the cultural tradition of Muslim Spain. I

8
00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:49.190
studied the traditional religious sciences,
law, and the arts necessary for a career in

9
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.030
government. I served in Granada, Cairo and
many middle eastern and North African governments

10
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.550
of the day in many ways seeking stability,
peace and influence.

11
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.949
I have many books and publications in the
fields of economy, philosophy, evolutionary

12
00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.950
biology, and sociology. I observed that a
society in its earliest stages is nomadic

13
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.460
and primarily concerned with survival, while
a society at a later stage is sedentary, with

14
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.829
greater achievement in crafts. I also emphasized
the important aspect that educational tradition

15
00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:28.869
plays to ensure the new generations of a civilization
continuously improve in the sciences and develop

16
00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:35.260
culture. The most famous book I wrote is the
Book of Lessons, a history of the world. The

17
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.399
first part, Muqaddimah which translates as
the Introduction, is often used alone. This

18
00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.340
book is often credited as inventing sociology.
Public recognition of my work has increased

19
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.850
in recent years. In 2004, the Tunisian Community
Center launched the first Ibn Khaldun Award

20
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.429
to recognize a Tunisian/American high achiever
whose work reflects my ideas of kinship and

21
00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.450
solidarity. In 2006, Spain commemorated the
600th anniversary of the death of my life

22
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.450
by orchestrating an exhibit titled "Encounter
of Civilizations: Ibn Khaldun.". I have been

23
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.450
cherished by modern leaders such as Vladimir
Lenin, Ronald Reagan and many others.

24
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.319
I am described as the founder of the modern
disciplines of historiography, sociology,

25
00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:13.000
economics, and demography. I hope my works
have contributed to the prosperity of all

26
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.810
civilizations across the world.
