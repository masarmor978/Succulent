00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:11.590
I am Hideyo Noguchi, also known as Noguchi
Seisaku, born in “1876” at Accra, the

2
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.780
Gold Coast colony, current day Ghana.

3
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.039
I am bacteriologist who first discovered Treponema
pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis,

4
00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.289
in the brains of persons suffering from paresis.

5
00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.589
I also proved that both Oroya fever and verruga
peruana could be produced by Bartonella bacilliformis.

6
00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:38.720
I graduated in “1897” from a proprietary
medical school in Tokyo and then went in “1900”

7
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.540
to the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia,
where I worked on snake venoms under Simon

8
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.000
Flexner.

9
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.920
In “1904” I went to the Rockefeller Institute
for Medical Research, New York City, which

10
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.910
sponsored my work for almost a quarter of
a century.

11
00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.130
I devised means of cultivating microorganisms
that had never before been grown in the test

12
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.160
tube.

13
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.440
I studied poliomyelitis and trachoma and worked
on a vaccine and serum for yellow fever.

14
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.659
In 1928, I died of yellow fever, which I contracted
during research on the disease in Africa.

15
00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.720
In the same year, the Japanese government
awarded me the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold

16
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.830
and Silver Star, which represents the second
highest of eight classes associated with the

17
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.170
award.

18
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.330
In 1979, the Noguchi Memorial Institute for
Medical Research was founded with funds donated

19
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.170
by the Japanese government at the University
of Ghana in Legon, a suburb north of Accra.

20
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.159
My portrait has been printed on Japanese 1000-yen
banknotes since 2004.

21
00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.630
In addition, the house near Inawashiro where
I was born and brought up is preserved.

22
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.890
It is operated as part of a museum to my life
and achievements.

23
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.520
I gave my life to science and to build better
medications and I hope the world has become

24
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.780
much safer place now.
