00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:09.200
I am Peter Mohyla, born in 1596 in Moldavia,&nbsp;
current-day Romania. I am an Orthodox monk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.080
and theologian of Moldavian origin who served as&nbsp;
metropolitan of Kyiv and who authored the Orthodox&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.600
Confession of the Catholic and Apostolic Eastern&nbsp;
Church. I reformed Slavic theological scholarship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.240
and generally set doctrinal standards for Eastern&nbsp;
Orthodoxy that endured until the 19th century.&nbsp;

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.360
My family is from a royal Moldavian&nbsp;
lineage, I migrated to Polish Ukraine;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.840
I was educated in Jesuit schools in Poland&nbsp;
and became proficient in Classical languages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.760
and Latin Scholastic theology. I entered the&nbsp;
famous Monastery of the Caves at Kyiv in 1625&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.920
and was made it’s superior in a few years.
In 1633 I was elected metropolitan of Kyiv.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.240
As a metropolitan, I made great efforts&nbsp;
to improve the education of my clergy and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.640
laity at a time when both Roman Catholic and&nbsp;
Protestant missionaries were very active among&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.080
the Orthodox population of Poland and Ukraine.
I transformed the theological college of the Kyiv&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.520
monastery into a school of humanities and theology&nbsp;
and enlisted a Western-trained faculty for it. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.720
academy became the source of a theological revival&nbsp;
in the entire Russian Orthodox Church, and its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.000
influence was felt in Russia until the end of the&nbsp;
19th century. I also obtained the Polish monarch’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.320
acknowledgment of the rights of the Orthodox&nbsp;
church in Polish territory, and I restored to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.720
Orthodox control the churches and properties&nbsp;
that had been expropriated by Roman Catholics.&nbsp;

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.760
To bring order to Orthodox theology in its&nbsp;
two-fronted controversy with the Roman church&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.200
and with Protestant reformers, in 1640, I composed&nbsp;
The Orthodox Confession of Faith of the Eastern&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.160
Orthodox Church. It was approved by the four&nbsp;
Eastern patriarchs and was formally approved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.160
at the Synod of Jerusalem in 1672. It remains&nbsp;
one of the primary outlines of Eastern Orthodox&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.160
doctrines as set forth in the refutation&nbsp;
of Roman Catholic and Protestant claims.&nbsp;

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.160
I bequeathed most of my estate to various church&nbsp;
institutions, mostly to the Kyivan Mohyla College.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.092
I died in 1647 praying that faith will unite&nbsp;
the hearts of all humans across the world.
