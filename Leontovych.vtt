00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:09.120
I am Mykola Leontovych, born in 1877 in&nbsp;
Monastyrok, Bratslav county in Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.160
I am a composer, conductor, and teacher.&nbsp;
I specialized in Cappella choral music,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.640
ranging from original compositions to church&nbsp;
music, to elaborate arrangements of folk music.&nbsp;

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.400
After graduating from the theological&nbsp;
seminary in Kamianets-Podilskyi in 1899,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.120
I worked as a teacher at various schools&nbsp;
in Kyiv, Katerynoslav, and Podilia.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.920
I furthered my music education on an ongoing&nbsp;
basis through private study in Saint Petersburg,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.880
where I earned my credentials as a choirmaster&nbsp;
of church choruses. In spite of the popularity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.160
of my compositions, My work was generally&nbsp;
unrecognized until I was brought to Kyiv in 1918&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.840
to teach at Kyiv Conservatory and the&nbsp;
Lysenko Music and Drama Institute.&nbsp;

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.880
My musical heritage consists primarily&nbsp;
of more than 150 choral compositions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.240
inspired by the texts and melodies of Ukrainian&nbsp;
folk songs. My earlier works consist mainly of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.280
strophic arrangements of folk songs. in later&nbsp;
years I developed a strophic-variational form&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.400
strongly related to the text. A group of&nbsp;
my compositions, including Epiphany Carol,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.200
Dudaryk, and the Playing Rabbit, depart from the&nbsp;
simple settings of folk songs and constitute my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.400
most original and artistic compositions. The&nbsp;
harmony of my choral compositions is described&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.120
by scholars as being rich and innovative, an&nbsp;
important role being played by vocal polyphony,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.640
including the use of imitation techniques. My&nbsp;
unfinished opera called, On Rusalka Easter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.680
based on Borys Hrinchenko's fairy tale, was the&nbsp;
first attempt at a Ukrainian fantastic opera.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.840
This opera was completed in 1977 by composer&nbsp;
Myroslav Skoryk and writer Diodor Bobyr.&nbsp;

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.920
In 1921, I died in tragic circumstances,&nbsp;
being shot by a Cheka agent at my parents'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.160
home. My creativity outlived my life&nbsp;
as it played an important role in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.000
development of Ukrainian choral tradition&nbsp;
and influenced composers of succeeding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.600
generations. My works were popularized and became&nbsp;
the basis of the repertoire of many choral groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.269
they obtained high praise from critics as well as&nbsp;
widespread popularity in Ukraine and elsewhere.
