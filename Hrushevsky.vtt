00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.480
I am Mykhailo Hrushevsky. born in&nbsp;
1866 in Kholm, current-day Poland.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.520
I am a Ukrainian academician, politician,&nbsp;
historian, and statesman who IS one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.240
the most important figures of the Ukrainian&nbsp;
national revival of the early 20th century.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.120
I am often considered the country's&nbsp;
greatest modern historian, the leader of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.000
the pre-revolution Ukrainian national movement,&nbsp;
and the head of the revolutionary parliament&nbsp;

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.760
My mother was from an Orthodox priest family&nbsp;
while my father was a highly-decorated official.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.680
I entered Saint Volodymyr University, in&nbsp;
Kyiv. I always believed my family are real&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.400
patriots of Ukraine, who managed to instill&nbsp;
a sense of national pride in their children.&nbsp;

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.480
I authored the first detailed scholarly synthesis&nbsp;
of Ukrainian history. I claimed the ancient&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.080
Ukrainian steppe cultures from Scythia to Kyivan&nbsp;
Rus to the Cossacks as part of Ukrainian heritage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.920
I always emphasized native Ukrainian factors&nbsp;
rather than international ones as the causes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.640
of various phenomena. I also stressed&nbsp;
the national aspect of the Ukrainian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.880
Renaissance of the 16th and 17th centuries.
I spoke out against Polish political predominance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.760
and Ruthenian particularism and supported a&nbsp;
national Ukrainian identity that would unite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.480
both eastern and western parts of the country.&nbsp;
In 1917, I was elected head of the revolutionary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.280
parliament, in Kyiv and gradually guided it&nbsp;
from Ukrainian national autonomy within a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.760
democratic Russia to complete independence. I was&nbsp;
considered a radical democrat and a socialist.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.520
In 1919, I emigrated, having acquired a&nbsp;
mandate from the Ukrainian Party of Socialist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.280
Revolutionaries to co-ordinate the activities&nbsp;
of its representatives abroad. It took us years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.840
to come back to Ukraine struggling against&nbsp;
Russian influence and forming the legislation.&nbsp;

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.240
Back in Ukraine, I concentrated on academic&nbsp;
work. Above all, I continued writing my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.680
monumental History of Ukraine-RusÊ¹. In 1931, after&nbsp;
a long campaign against me in the Soviet press,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.560
I was exiled to Moscow. In 1934, under the&nbsp;
close watch of the Soviet political police,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.640
I died during routine minor surgery in the&nbsp;
Caucasus, at the age of 68. My goal was to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.385
protect the Ukrainian sense of unity and&nbsp;
I hope this feeling is preserved forever.
