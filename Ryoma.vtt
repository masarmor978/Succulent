00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.450
I am Sakamoto, Ryoma , Born on 1835 in Kochi,
the son of a country samurai of from an established

2
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.360
branch of the wealthy Saitani clan.

3
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.390
In 1853 I became a disciple of Sadakichi Chiba,
a master swordsman of the martial art style

4
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.029
of fencingand become famous as an excellent
swordsman.

5
00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.300
In 1861 I joined the Tosa Imperialism party,
formed by Zuizan Takechi.

6
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.970
In 1862, I quit the clan and moved up to Edo,
current day Tokyo, and worked hard to construct

7
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.220
the Kobe Naval Operations Training School.

8
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.250
In 1865, I established a young men's group
in Nagasaki.

9
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.890
I devoted myself to the conclusion of the
Satsuma Alliance and was present at the scene

10
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.400
of the compact between Takamori Saigo and
Takayoshi Kido in 1866.

11
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.190
While moving up to Edo from Nagasaki by sea
with Shojiro Goto in 1867, I put together

12
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.460
my own political blueprint, known as the Eight
plans written on board ship.

13
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.390
In the same year I was assassinated in Kyoto
together with Shintaro Nakaoka.

14
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.870
One year later, Boshin War started that led
to the imperial victory in 1869.

15
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:32.120
Subsequently, the Meiji government set to
work building a new state.

16
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.530
My political and economic achievements along
with the more personal touches found in my

17
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.780
letters have formed the basis for many books,
films, and television dramas in the years

18
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.780
to follow.

19
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.270
I did not live to see my efforts to modernize
the country bear fruit.

20
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.850
I hope Japan has become as I always imagined,
modern, civilized and a world beacon of enlightenment.
