00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:11.940
I am Jan Joosten van Lodensteyn from the Netherlands,
I was born in 1556 in Delft city. I am known

2
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.930
in Japanese as Yayosu. I am considered as
one of the first Dutchmen in Japan, and the

3
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.160
second mate on the Dutch ship De Liefde, which
was stranded in Japan in 1600. Foreigners

4
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.949
were not welcomed in Japan in that time; however,
I was allowed to take a Japanese wife and

5
00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.600
was given a permit to engage in foreign trade.
I was privileged to wear the two swords of

6
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.200
the samurai and received an annual stipend
which placed me among the ranks of the direct

7
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.000
retainers of the shogun. I was granted a house
in Tokyo in an area that came to be called

8
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.520
"Yayosu Quay" after me. My name was pronounced
yan yosuten in Japanese. The Yaesu side of

9
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.940
Tokyo Station is also named after me.
My endeavor to Japan started in 1598 from

10
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.940
Rotterdam on my ship. I was on a trading voyage
that was a five-ship expedition to the East

11
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.549
Indies. After making it through the Straits
of Magellan. Due to a storm, my ship was damaged

12
00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:19.770
and made landfall off Bungo (current day Usuki)
on the coast of Kyushu in 1600. The ship was

13
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.310
seized on orders of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the daimyo
of Tokyo, who questioned us at length on European

14
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.480
politics, wars and foreign affairs. Our ship
canons were used by Ieyasu at the decisive

15
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.729
Battle of Sekigahara in 1600.
I am reported to have made a fortune in trade

16
00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.020
between Japan and Southeast Asia, chartering
several Red Seal Ships under license from

17
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.549
Tokugawa Ieyasu. After the establishment of
the Dutch Factory in Hirado, I became a middleman

18
00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.229
between Dutch merchants and the shogunate.
I kept sailing and trading until my last voyage

19
00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.950
in 1623 returning from Thailand to Japan,
but after reaching Batavia, I was denied permission

20
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.060
by Dutch authorities to proceed further. I
drowned in the South China Sea in that year.

21
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.730
I loved connecting world civilizations and
exchanging culture and goods and I hope this

22
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.389
is how nations still see each other, through
the eyes of respect and rich heritage.
