I am Ivan Franko. born in 1856 in Lviv&nbsp;
Oblast, Ukraine. I am a Ukrainian poet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.840
writer, social and literary critic, journalist,&nbsp;
interpreter, economist, political activist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.400
doctor of philosophy, ethnographer, and&nbsp;
the author of the first detective novels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.240
and modern poetry in the Ukrainian language.
As a child, I was baptized as Ivan by Father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.120
Yosyp Levytsky, known as a poet and the author&nbsp;
of the first Galician-Ruthenian Hramatyka.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.880
At home, however, I was called Myron because&nbsp;
of a local superstitious belief that naming a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.880
person by a different name will dodge a death. My&nbsp;
family in Nahuyevychi was considered "well-to-do",&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.160
with their own servants and 24&nbsp;
hectares of its own property.&nbsp;

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.480
I studied classical philosophy at Lviv University.&nbsp;
That’s where I began my literary career and met&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.240
Mykhailo Drahomanov who was a great national&nbsp;
thinker at Lviv University. This made a huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.680
impression on me and established a long political&nbsp;
and literary association. My writings and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.320
associations led to my arrest in 1877. However,&nbsp;
the nine months in prison did not discourage my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.400
political writing or activities. In prison,&nbsp;
I wrote the Smorhon Academy. After release,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.520
I studied the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich&nbsp;
Engels, contributed articles to the Labor Polish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.120
newspaper, and helped organize workers' groups&nbsp;
in Lviv. I was arrested numerous times in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.240
following years. At odds with the administration,&nbsp;
I was expelled from Lviv University,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.520
an institution that would be renamed the Ivan&nbsp;
Franko National University of Lviv after my death.&nbsp;

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.480
I was a political radical, and a founder of&nbsp;
the socialist and nationalist movement in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.600
western Ukraine. In addition to my own&nbsp;
literary work, I also translated many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.960
international works of such renowned figures&nbsp;
as William Shakespeare, Lord Byron, von Goethe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.880
and Friedrich Schiller into Ukrainian. Along with&nbsp;
Taras Shevchenko, I had a tremendous impact on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.480
modern literary and political thought in Ukraine.
My life spun over my love for my nation and its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.640
people’s long history of sacrifices and&nbsp;
fights for their freedom and prosperity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.059
I died in 1916 surrounded by many&nbsp;
people who believed in my nation’s love.
