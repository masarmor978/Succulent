00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.400
I am Ostrozky Kostiantyn born in 1460&nbsp;
in Ostroh, Current day Lithuania.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.520
I am a Ukrainian nobleman and&nbsp;
prominent military and cultural leader.&nbsp;

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:20.480
In the late 1480s, I served at the Vilnius&nbsp;
court of King Casimir IV. In the later years, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.400
distinguished myself during a Lithuanian-Muscovite&nbsp;
war, and headed an army responsible for defending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.760
Right-Bank Ukraine from Tatar attacks. From&nbsp;
1497, I served as the grand hetman of Lithuania.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.200
I commanded my armies in over thirty&nbsp;
victorious battles against the Crimean Tatars.&nbsp;

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.760
In 1500 I was wounded and taken prisoner by the&nbsp;
Muscovites during the battle on the Vedrosh River.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.960
But managed to escape to the&nbsp;
Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1507.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.600
Reinstated as grand hetman, I continued my&nbsp;
successful military career. Among my most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.640
celebrated victories were those of the large&nbsp;
strong Muscovite army at the Battle of Orsha in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.960
1514 and of the Crimean Tatars at Olshanytsia in&nbsp;
the Kyiv region in 1527, after which 25,000 Tatars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.800
were taken prisoner and settled near Ostroh.
My military victories earned me considerable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.920
fame among my contemporaries. I served as mayor&nbsp;
of Bratslav, Zvenyhorodka, Vinnytsia, starosta&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.800
of Lutsk and marshal of Volhynia, castellan&nbsp;
of Vilnius, and palatine of Trakai from 1522.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.960
One of the five wealthiest magnates in the&nbsp;
Lithuanian-Ruthenian state, I was a defender&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.880
and patron of the Orthodox church. I built&nbsp;
numerous churches in Ukraine and Lithuania,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.880
including two Orthodox churches in Vilnius&nbsp;
and the Trinity Monastery in Ostroh. I built&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.560
the Kyivan Cave Monastery and was buried in the&nbsp;
Dormition Cathedral of the Kyivan Cave Monastery.&nbsp;

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.800
My time was characterized by a major efflorescence&nbsp;
of Ukrainian culture and a rise in the level of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.960
popular education. Many cities became the&nbsp;
center of national and spiritual expansion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.640
I assisted in allowing a large library of Greek&nbsp;
and Western European theological literature,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.840
reprints of ancient literary works, dictionaries,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.320
cosmographies, and grammar to accumulate in&nbsp;
Ukraine. I worked day and night to let Ukrainians&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.828
live in pride and dignity and I hope our nation&nbsp;
is a beacon of enlightenment, peace, and harmony.
