00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:09.849
I am Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, born in 1836,
in Whitechapel, east London, The United Kingdom.

2
00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.750
I was a pioneering physician, political campaigner
and the first Englishwoman to qualify as a

3
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.970
doctor.
During my childhood, my father became a successful

4
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.710
businessman, enabling him to send his children
to good schools. After school, I was expected

5
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.340
to live the life of a lady. However, meetings
with the feminist Emily Davies and Elizabeth

6
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.630
Blackwell, the first American woman physician,
convinced me that I should become a doctor.

7
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.900
This was unheard of in 19th century Britain
and my attempts to study at several medical

8
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.030
schools were denied. I enrolled as a nursing
student at Middlesex Hospital and attended

9
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.310
classes intended for male doctors but was
barred after complaints from other students.

10
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.170
As the Society of Apothecaries did not specifically
forbid women from taking their examinations,

11
00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.030
in 1865, I passed their exams and gained a
certificate which enabled me to become a doctor.

12
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.369
The society then changed its rules to prevent
other women entering the profession this way.

13
00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.940
With my father's backing, in 1866, I established
a dispensary for women in London and was made

14
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.539
a visiting physician to the East London Hospital.
Here, I met James Anderson, a successful businessman,

15
00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:24.689
who I married in 1871. I remained determined
to obtain a medical degree, so I taught myself

16
00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.829
French and went to the University of Paris,
where I successfully earned my degree. The

17
00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.729
British Medical Register refused to recognize
my qualification.

18
00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.479
In 1872, I founded the New Hospital for Women
in London with my mentor, Elizabeth Blackwell,

19
00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.670
as the professor of gynecology there.
My determination paved the way for other women,

20
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.189
and in 1876 an act was passed permitting women
to enter the medical professions. In 1883,

21
00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.030
I was appointed dean of the London School
of Medicine for Women, which I had helped

22
00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.959
to found in 1874, and oversaw its expansion.
In 1908, I became the mayor of Alde burgh

23
00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:07.639
town, the first female mayor in England. I
died in 1917, wishing women would get their

24
00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:10.190
chance everywhere to contribute more to a
better future.
