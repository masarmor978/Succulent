00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:10.060
I am Albert Einstein, born in 1879 in Ulm,
Germany. I am a physicist who developed the

2
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.980
special and general theories of relativity
and won the Nobel Prize for my explanation

3
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.900
of the photoelectric effect. I am considered
the most influential physicist of the 20th

4
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.590
century.
At the age of fifteen, I quit high school,

5
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.140
disgusted by rote learning and martinet teachers
but later entered the Federal Institute of

6
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.060
Technology in Zurich. I couldn’t find jobs
for two grim years until I finally got a post

7
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.620
as a patent examiner. I wrote four fundamental
papers, all in a few months, analyzing light

8
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.730
as quanta, proposing a proof of the existence
of atoms, forming a connection between electromagnetic

9
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.550
theory and ordinary motion and finally showing
that mass and energy are two parts of the

10
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.530
same thing.
I continued my academic journey and attended

11
00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.590
many conferences allowing me to meet many
fellow scientists, namely at the exclusive

12
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.670
Solvay Conference. In 1915, I completed my
general theory of relativity receiving stunning

13
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.670
global appreciation. Overturning ancient notions
of space and time, I reached a new understanding

14
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.770
of gravity. In 1918, I became more involved
in politics and supported a new progressive

15
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.560
party in Germany after the first world war.
I visited the United States to help raise

16
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.829
funds for the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
The following year, I received the Nobel Prize.

17
00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.280
Unwilling to live in Germany under Nazi government
in the 1930’s, I joined the Institute for

18
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.179
Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. I
signed a letter informing President Roosevelt

19
00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.750
of the possibility of nuclear bombs, warning
that the Germans might try to build them.

20
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.200
I worked on my unified field theory and in
1950, I published an article about it and

21
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.889
died five years later of an aortic aneurysm
without completing my last work. I want to

22
00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:08.890
know how God created this world. I am not
interested in this or that phenomenon. I want

23
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.030
to know His thoughts; the rest are details.
I hope we know the universe better now and

24
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.450
we keep exploring its mysteries seeking better
future for us all.
