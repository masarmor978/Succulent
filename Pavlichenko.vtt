00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.240
I am Lyudmila Pavlichenko. Born&nbsp;
in 1916 in Bila Tserkva, Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.080
I am a Soviet sniper in the Red Army during World&nbsp;
War II, who was credited with 309 deaths, making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.680
me the most successful female sniper in recorded&nbsp;
history. I served in the Red Army during the siege&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.400
of Odesa and the siege of Sevastopol, during the&nbsp;
early stages of the fighting on the Eastern Front.&nbsp;

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:31.360
My family moved to Kyiv when I was aged 14. As&nbsp;
a child, I was a self-described tomboy fiercely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.800
competitive at athletic activities. In Kyiv,&nbsp;
I joined a shooting club, developed into an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.200
amateur sharpshooter, and earned the Voroshilov&nbsp;
Sharpshooter badge and a marksman certificate.&nbsp;

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.400
I enrolled at Kyiv University in 1937,&nbsp;
where I studied history and intended&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.520
to be a scholar and teacher. I competed on&nbsp;
the university's track team as a sprinter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.160
I was also enrolled in a military-style&nbsp;
sniping school for six months by the Red Army.&nbsp;

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.040
In June 1941, I was aged 24 in my fourth year&nbsp;
studying history at Kyiv University when Nazi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.240
Germany began its invasion of the Soviet&nbsp;
Union. After many requests to join the army,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.680
my enrollment was accepted as a sniper. A&nbsp;
fallen comrade once handed me his rifle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.200
I then shot my first two enemies&nbsp;
and proved myself to my comrades.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.320
I called that day the "baptism of fire" because&nbsp;
that was when I officially became a sniper.&nbsp;

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.920
I fought during the siege of Odesa and Sevastopol&nbsp;
climbing the ranks to be Lieutenant Pavlichenko.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.280
My total of confirmed kills during World War&nbsp;
II was 309, including 36 Axis snipers. My&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.240
high kill count gave me the nickname "Lady&nbsp;
Death." I also trained snipers for combat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.080
duty until the end of the war and become&nbsp;
a senior researcher for the Soviet Navy.&nbsp;

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.120
I toured the United States, Canada, and the&nbsp;
United Kingdom to share my willingness to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.320
fight for freedom. I died of a stroke at the&nbsp;
age of 58 but I lived my life to the limit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.124
defending my peopleâ€™s life&nbsp;
to live in dignity and honor.
