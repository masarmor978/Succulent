00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:11.280
I am Sun Tzu, born in 544 BCE, at the Kingdom 
of Wu, China. My Art of War book is studied and  

2
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.240
quoted in military strategy courses and 
corporate boardrooms around the world. 

3
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.760
I grew up in a military family and studied 
military science. I served the Kingdom of Wu  

4
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.080
as an army general and strategist. I won battles 
by not actually fighting my enemy when it wasn't  

5
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.640
necessary. I recommended spies, deception and a 
commander having complete control of his soldiers.  

6
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.520
When I did fight, I understood warfare 
better than most of my opponents.  

7
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.840
I learned to win battles with 
the least loss of my own men.  

8
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.360
My military successes inspired me to write 
The Art of War, which became popular with  

9
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:57.840
strategists from all seven rival kingdoms during 
the Warring States Period between 475 to 221 BCE. 

10
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.320
I proposed various maneuvers to utilize effect of 
terrain on the outcome of battles. I emphasized  

11
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.080
the unpredictability of battle and the use of 
flexible strategies and tactics. I believed  

12
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.720
in the close relationship between political 
considerations and military policy. My vision has  

13
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.680
had a profound influence on military thinkers 
over the past two thousand years and more. 

14
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.320
Tradition avers that the first emperor of unified 
China, relied on The Art of War as a strategic  

15
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.600
guide when he conquered the other warring states 
in 221 BCE. During the Lushan Rebellion in China,  

16
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.800
fleeing officials brought my book to Japan, 
where it greatly influenced samurai warfare.  

17
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.640
Japan's unifiers, American Union officers and army 
officials, Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong;  

18
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.720
and Ho Chi Minh. All thoroughly studied my book 
and applied its strategies to serve their causes. 

19
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.480
He will win who knows when to 
fight and when not to fight.  

20
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.880
I delivered to the world a book to 
make battles swift when necessary.  

21
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.080
I hope the world has learned that war isn’t 
the answer for every problem and people are  

22
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:18.640
seeing peace and prosperity as opportunities, 
opportunities that multiply as they are seized.
