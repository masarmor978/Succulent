00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.000
I am Marco Polo. Born in 1254&nbsp;
in Venice, current-day Italy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.800
I am known as a Venetian traveler and writer who&nbsp;
was one of the first westerners to visit China.
 &nbsp;

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.120
I am from a wealthy and cosmopolitan&nbsp;
Venetian merchant family.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.200
My father and uncle were jewel merchants. In&nbsp;
1260, they left Venice to travel to the Black Sea,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.160
moving onwards to central Asia and joining a&nbsp;
diplomatic mission to the court of Kublai Khan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.840
the Mongol ruler of China. Khan asked my father&nbsp;
and uncle to return to Europe and persuade the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.080
pope to send scholars to explain Christianity&nbsp;
to him. They arrived back in Venice in 1269.
 &nbsp;

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.640
In 1271, they set off again,&nbsp;
accompanied by two missionaries and me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.200
and in 1275 reached Khan's summer court. For the&nbsp;
next 17 years, we lived in the emperor's lands.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.560
I was popular with the Mongol ruler and was sent&nbsp;
on various diplomatic missions which gave me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.720
the opportunity to see many parts of China.
 
Around 1292, our family offered to accompany&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.560
a Mongol princess who was to become the consort&nbsp;
of Arghun Khan in Persia. The party sailed from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.480
a southern Chinese port in southern India and the&nbsp;
Persian Gulf. After leaving the princess in Iran,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.600
we traveled overland to Constantinople and&nbsp;
then to Venice, arriving home in 1295.
 &nbsp;

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.960
I became involved in a naval conflict&nbsp;
between Venice and Genoa and in 1298 was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.960
captured by the Genoese. In prison, my stories&nbsp;
attracted the attention of a writer from Pisa,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.440
Rustichello, who began to write them down,&nbsp;
frequently embellishing them as I went.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.400
The resulting book was extremely popular&nbsp;
and was translated into many languages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.800
under several titles, including 'The&nbsp;
Million' and the 'Travels of Marco Polo'.
 &nbsp;

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.920
After I was released from prison, I&nbsp;
returned to Venice and died in 1324.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.360
The world is filled with wonders. I did not tell&nbsp;
half of what I saw, for I knew I would not be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.860
believed. But I hope the few stories I shared can&nbsp;
spark many people's interest to travel and see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:03.554
true world beyond the walls of their cities.
