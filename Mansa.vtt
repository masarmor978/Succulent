00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.640
I am Mansa Musa. Born in 1280 in Mali. I am the&nbsp;
fourteenth century emperor of the Mali Empire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.320
My empire stretched across two thousand miles from&nbsp;
the Atlantic Ocean to Lake Chad and which included&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.400
all or parts of the modern nations of Mauritania,&nbsp;
Senegal, Gambia, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Mali,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:32.480
Niger, Nigeria, and Chad, ensured decades of peace&nbsp;
and prosperity in Western Africa. During my reign,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.920
Mali was one of Africa's richest nations, and I&nbsp;
was among the richest individuals in the world. 
 &nbsp;

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.840
In 1312 I became emperor following the death of&nbsp;
my predecessor, Abu-Bakr the second. I was given&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.640
the name Mansa meaning king. I worked thoroughly&nbsp;
to expand internal and external trade. I became&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.840
the first Muslim ruler in West Africa to make&nbsp;
the nearly four-thousand-mile journey to Mecca.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.440
Preparing for the expedition&nbsp;
took years and involved the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.960
work of artisans in numerous&nbsp;
towns and cities across Mali.
 &nbsp;

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.760
In 1324, accompanied by thousands of richly&nbsp;
dressed servants and supporters, I made generous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.400
gold donations to the poor and to charitable&nbsp;
organizations as well as the rulers of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.040
lands my entourage crossed. My donations caused&nbsp;
a brief decline in gold value for a few years.
 &nbsp;

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.720
Upon my return from Mecca, I invited&nbsp;
Arab scholars, government bureaucrats,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.400
and architects. They introduced advanced building&nbsp;
techniques and structures to Mali such as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.840
mosque at Gao and the still-standing great mosque&nbsp;
at Timbuktu, the largest city in the empire.
 &nbsp;

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.320
My pilgrimage boosted Islamic education in&nbsp;
Mali by adding libraries and universities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.600
Timbuktu become one of the leading cities&nbsp;
in the Islamic world during the time when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.080
the most advanced nations from Spain to central&nbsp;
India were Muslim. My journey sparked Italian,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.400
German, and Spanish cartographers to produce maps&nbsp;
referring to me and my empire. The first of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:12.240
maps appeared in Italy in 1339 with my name.
 
I died in 1337 after a twenty-five-year reign&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.680
leaving a robust government that lasted&nbsp;
for many prosperous years. I hope fortunate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.571
people are still sharing their wealth with the&nbsp;
needy as this is what makes us live in peace.
