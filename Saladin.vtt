00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:10.740
I am Al-Nasir Salah al-Din born in 1137 in
Tikrit, current day Iraq. I am a Muslim military

2
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.500
and political leader who led Islamic forces
during the Crusades. My greatest triumph over

3
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.890
the Crusaders came at the Battle of Hattin
in 1187, which paved the way for Islamic re-conquest

4
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.029
of Jerusalem and other Holy Land cities in
the Near East.

5
00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.369
I rose rapidly within Muslim society and joined
three campaigns into Egypt and became head

6
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.330
of the military expeditionary forces in 1169.
I participated in stabilizing the political

7
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.360
scene in Egypt. I did the same in Syria, Damascus,
and Yemen which turned the military balance

8
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.160
of power in my favor by uniting a great number
of unruly forces and employing improved military

9
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.260
techniques. I fought battles against Englandâ€™s
King Richard I armies leading to a truce that

10
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:03.430
allowed for continued Muslim regional recontrol.
In 1187, I was able to throw my full strength

11
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.380
into the struggle with Crusader kingdoms.
I trapped and destroyed in one blow an army

12
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.080
of Crusaders at Hattin, northern Palestine.
So great were the losses in the ranks of the

13
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.540
Crusaders in Hattin that the Muslims quickly
overrun nearly the entire kingdom of Jerusalem.

14
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:30.140
Acre, Toron, Beirut, Sidon, Nazareth, Caesarea,
Nablus, Yafo, and Ascalon fell within three

15
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.090
months. The most disastrous blow to Crusaders
came on 1187, when Jerusalem, holy to both

16
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.210
Muslim and Christian alike, surrendered to
my army after 88 years in the hands of the

17
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.440
Franks. I never forgot the slaughter of Muslims
by Crusaders in Jerusalem in 1099, but I agreed

18
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.671
to let them purchase their freedom provided
that the Christian defenders left the Muslim

19
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:59.570
inhabitants unmolested.
I died of a fever on 1193. I gave away my

20
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.560
great wealth to my poor subjects, leaving
nothing to pay for my funeral. My reputation

21
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.920
for generosity, religiosity, and commitment
to the higher principles of a holy war have

22
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.480
been idealized by Muslim sources and by many
Westerners. I unified people from many ethnicities

23
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.950
to defend their right to coexist and I hope
their right to live in dignity is preserved

24
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:22.450
to this day.
