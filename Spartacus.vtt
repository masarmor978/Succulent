00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:10.720
I am Spartacus, born in 111 BC in Thrace, 
current day Balkan region. I am a Roman slave and  

2
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.120
gladiator, and leader of a famous slave revolt. 
I have become a modern-day inspirational figure. 

3
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.040
I was sold into slavery and trained 
at the gladiatorial school in Capua,  

4
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:30.800
north of Naples. I served in the Roman army. 
In 73 BC, I escaped and took refuge on nearby  

5
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.040
Mount Vesuvius, where large numbers 
of other escaped slaves joined me.  

6
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.640
our insurrection came to be known as the Third 
Servile War, or the Gladiators’ War. I lead  

7
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.160
my army of runaway slaves, which has been 
estimated to have reached 100,000 men, and  

8
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.280
defeated a series of Roman attacks using tactics 
which would now be called guerrilla warfare. 

9
00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.520
In 72 BC, I and my army marched north towards 
France and northern Italy. We fought off a  

10
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.160
series of attacks from Roman forces, but 
then turned south. By the end of 72 BC,  

11
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.920
we were camped at Rhenium, current day Reggio 
di Calabria, intending to go on to Sicily. 

12
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.080
The administration in Rome now began to take 
the threat from my actions seriously and the  

13
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.640
Roman politician and general Marcus 
Licinius Crassus led an army south.  

14
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.240
We managed to break through the fortifications 
that Crassus had built to trap us but were pursued  

15
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.960
to Lucania where the rebel army was destroyed. 
I was killed in the battle. Around 6,000 of my  

16
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.040
followers who escaped were hunted down and 
crucified. Thousands of others were killed  

17
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.320
by the army of the Roman general Pompey, who then 
claimed the credit for suppressing the rebellion. 

18
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.160
My struggle has been inspirational 
to revolutionaries, politicians,  

19
00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.800
and writers since the 19th century. A man must 
accept his fate or be destroyed by it. My life  

20
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.680
was dedicated to liberating slaves and give them 
the right to make choices about their own lives.  

21
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:16.640
I hope all humans across the world are 
living with justice away from tyranny.
