00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:09.420
I am Sophie Friederike, also known as Catherine
the Great, born in 1729 in Stettin, current

2
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.400
day Poland. I was the Empress of Russia for
more than 30 years and one of the countryâ€™s

3
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.920
most influential rulers.
In 1745, after being received into the Russian

4
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.240
Orthodox Church, I married Grand Duke Peter,
grandson of Peter the Great and heir to the

5
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.960
Russian throne. The fruit of this marriage
was our only son, Paul. In 1762 my husband

6
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.280
became Tsar Peter III but he was soon overthrown
with me being declared empress.

7
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.010
My major influences on my adopted country
were in expanding Russia's borders and continuing

8
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.410
the process of Westernization begun by Peter
the Great. During my reign I extended the

9
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.420
Russian empire southwards and westwards, adding
territories which included the Crimea, Belarus,

10
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.000
and Lithuania. Agreements with Prussia and
Austria led to three partitions of Poland,

11
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.920
in 1772, 1793, and 1795, extending Russia's
borders into central Europe.

12
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.580
I proposed many political and social reforms.
In 1767, I convened the Legislative Commission

13
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.980
to codify Russia's laws and, in the process,
modernized Russian life presenting my vision

14
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:25.700
of the ideal government. However, the outbreak
of war against the Ottoman Empire in 1768

15
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.930
provided a good opportunity to disband it.
After the Russian army crushed the Pugachev

16
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.030
Rebellion in 1775, I realized my heavy reliance
on the nobility to control the country and

17
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.340
instigated a series of reforms giving them
greater control over their land and serfs.

18
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.480
My main interests were in education and culture.
I read widely and corresponded with many of

19
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.930
the prominent thinkers of the era, including
Voltaire and Diderot. I was a patron of the

20
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.610
arts, literature and education and acquired
an art collection which now forms the basis

21
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:05.390
of the Hermitage Museum. I died in St Petersburg
in 1796 and was succeeded by my son Paul.

22
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.340
One does not always do the best there is.
One does the best one can. I have dedicated

23
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.930
my passion to take Russia to unprecedented
success and I hope it is still to this day,

24
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.540
a torch of enlightenment and peace.
