00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.480
I am Ho Chi Minh. Born in 1890 in Hoang Tru in&nbsp;
central Vietnam. A Vietnamese nationalist for more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.760
than three decades, fighting first against the&nbsp;
Japanese, then the French colonial power, and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.000
the US-backed South Vietnamese. I was President&nbsp;
of North Vietnam from 1954 until my death.&nbsp;

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.120
When I was born, Vietnam was a French&nbsp;
colony, known as French Indo-China,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.600
but under the nominal rule of an emperor. In 1911,&nbsp;
I took a job on a French ship and traveled widely.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.480
I lived in London and Paris and was a&nbsp;
founding member of the French communist party.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.200
In 1923, I visited Moscow for training at&nbsp;
Comintern, an organization created by Lenin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.720
to promote the worldwide revolution. I traveled&nbsp;
to southern China to organize a revolutionary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.960
movement among Vietnamese exiles, and in 1930&nbsp;
founded the Indo-Chinese Communist Party (ICP).&nbsp;

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.920
After the Japanese invasion of Indo-China in&nbsp;
1941, I returned home and founded the Viet Minh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.280
a communist-dominated independence movement,&nbsp;
to fight the Japanese. I adopted the name&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.640
Ho Chi Minh, meaning 'Bringer of Light'.
At the end of World War Two, the Viet Minh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.960
announced Vietnamese independence. The French&nbsp;
refused to relinquish their colony and in 1946,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.240
war broke out. After eight years of war, the&nbsp;
French were forced to agree to peace talks in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.840
Geneva. The country was split into a communist&nbsp;
north and non-communist south and I became&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.360
president of North Vietnam. I was determined&nbsp;
to reunite Vietnam under communist rule.&nbsp;

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.640
By the early 1960s, North Vietnamese-backed&nbsp;
guerrillas, the Vietcong, were attacking the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.480
South Vietnamese government. Fearing the spread of&nbsp;
communism, the United States provided increasing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:55.200
levels of support to South Vietnam. By 1965,&nbsp;
large numbers of American troops were arriving,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.920
and the fighting escalated into a major conflict.
I died in 1969. 6 years from my death,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.200
the Vietcong took the South Vietnamese capital,&nbsp;
Saigon, and renamed it Ho Chi Minh City in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.360
my honor. To reap a return in ten years,&nbsp;
plant trees. To reap a return in 100 years,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.176
cultivate the people. I hope Vietnam is still&nbsp;
the blooming and fertile land I dreamed about.
