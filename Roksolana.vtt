00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.960
I am Roxelana, born in 1502 in Ruthenia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.480
Ukraine. I am the chief consort and legal wife&nbsp;
of the Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.320
I became one of the most powerful and&nbsp;
influential women in Ottoman history&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.600
as well as a prominent and controversial figure&nbsp;
during the era known as the Sultanate of Women.&nbsp;

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.840
My father was an Orthodox priest. My&nbsp;
hometown was raided by Crimean Tatars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.280
and I was eventually taken to Istanbul, the&nbsp;
Ottoman capital. I entered the Imperial house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.080
rose through the ranks, and became the favorite&nbsp;
of Sultan Suleiman. It was an ottoman tradition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.840
to only marry foreign free noble ladies. Breaking&nbsp;
Ottoman tradition, I married sultan Suleiman and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.640
he made me his first legal wife. I remained&nbsp;
in the sultan's court for the rest of my life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.600
enjoying a close and faithful relationship with&nbsp;
my husband, and having six children with him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.240
including the future sultan, Selim the second.&nbsp;
I was the grandmother of Murad the third.&nbsp;

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.080
I eventually achieved power, influencing the&nbsp;
politics of the Ottoman Empire. I played an active&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.600
role in the affairs of the state. I also acted as&nbsp;
the sultan's advisor, wrote diplomatic letters to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.920
King Sigismund the second, Augustus of Poland, and&nbsp;
patronized major public works in Sultan Complex.&nbsp;

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.200
So extraordinary was my success that my enemies&nbsp;
saw witchcraft as the only possible explanation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.480
for it. I was also characterized as a schemer&nbsp;
who plotted the assassination of İbrahim Pasha,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.640
the sultan’s chief minister and Suleyman’s&nbsp;
oldest surviving son who stood between my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.280
own remaining sons and the imperial succession.&nbsp;
the influence of the harem often overshadowed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.760
that of the grand vizier, resulting in&nbsp;
the so-called “Sultanate of the Women,” a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:45.440
state of affairs often attributed to my legacy.
I died in 1558, in Istanbul and was buried in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.520
mausoleum within the Suleymaniye Mosque complex.&nbsp;
My life was dedicated to my husband and our sons.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.480
I did my best to build a house that helped keeping&nbsp;
our empire strong from the inside and from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.178
outside. I am Roksolana, the Ukrainian queen&nbsp;
of the ottoman empire, the empress of the east.
