00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.790
I am Solomiya Krushelnytska.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.010
born in 1872 in Biliavyntsi, Ukraine.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.170
I am a Ukrainian soprano, considered to be
one of the brightest opera stars of the first

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.320
half of the 20th century.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.170
My family kept moving for several years from
village to village until our large family

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.650
settled on the outskirts of the regional metropolis
of Ternopil.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.609
I started singing at a young age.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.579
I received the basics of musical training
at the Ternopil Classical Gymnasium, where

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.659
I took external exams.

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.440
Here I became close to the music group of
high school students, a member of which was

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.239
also Denis Sichinsky - later a famous composer,
the first professional musician in Galicia.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.840
I later studied in Lviv and Milan under great
mentors who guided my career to unprecedented

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.360
professionalism.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.789
It was common for me to perform in numerous
countries in the same week with different

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:50.449
languages.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.129
In 1910, I married Italian attorney and the
mayor of Viareggio, Alfredo Riccioni.

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.839
In 1920, at the height of my career, I left
the opera world, and three years, later started

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.610
concert tours, performing in Western Europe,
Canada, and the USA.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.290
My knowledge of eight languages allowed me
to include in my concert programs songs of

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.820
many nations.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.830
I was a fervent promoter of Ukrainian folk
songs and works by Ukrainian composers.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.560
My family suggested I buy a house in our hometown.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.840
I bought a building so the entire family can
have more space to live in peace.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.670
When World War 2 started.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.200
Our neighborhood was leveled to the ground
and our building was occupied by the Germans

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.720
and the soviets.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.420
I lived under the soviet’s iron curtain
for the rest of my life as a trapped singer

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.950
until my death in 1952.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.520
During my life, I was recognized as the most
outstanding singer in the world.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.140
Among my numerous awards and distinctions,
in particular, I was called "Wagner's diva"

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.280
of the 20th century.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.840
Singing with me on the same stage was considered
an honor for Enrico Caruso, Titta Ruffo, and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.940
Fedor Chaliapin.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.930
It’s our choice to find beauty in the harsh
details of life.
