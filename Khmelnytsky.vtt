00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:09.760
I am Bohdan Khmelnytsky, born in 1595 in&nbsp;
Chigirin, Ukraine. I am the leader of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.960
Zaporozhian Cossacks who organized a rebellion&nbsp;
against Polish rule in Ukraine that ultimately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.680
led to the Polish losing control over the&nbsp;
Ukrainian lands east of the Dnieper River.&nbsp;

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.360
Although I had been educated in Poland and had&nbsp;
served with Polish military forces against the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.640
Turks, I, quarreled with the Polish governor&nbsp;
of Czyhryn and was forced to flee to a nearby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.000
Cossack’s fortress with other runaway serfs, and&nbsp;
traders who had settled along the Dnieper River.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.040
I then organized a rebellion among the&nbsp;
Zaporozhian Cossacks and with the support of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.160
the Crimean Tatars, marched against the Poles&nbsp;
in April 1648. My victorious advance granted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.680
me additional support from the dissatisfied&nbsp;
peasants, townspeople, and clergy of Ukraine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.320
who joined my side in a mass uprising that enabled&nbsp;
us to seize more territories from Poland in 1648.&nbsp;

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.440
Following numerous victories against&nbsp;
the Polish king, John Casimir,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.040
we made peace with Poland, concluding the&nbsp;
Compact of Zborów; granting us a virtually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.040
independent Cossack principality in Ukraine.
The peace treaty satisfied neither the Polish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.560
gentry nor the Cossack followers, many of&nbsp;
whom remained subject to Polish landlords;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.640
therefore, I renewed the war which&nbsp;
led to a less advantageous treaty.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.600
I conducted secret negotiations with Sweden,&nbsp;
which was also at war with Poland. I was about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.480
to conclude a treaty with the Swedes, placing the&nbsp;
Cossacks under Swedish rule when I died in 1657.&nbsp;

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.320
I sought autonomy for my Cossack followers but&nbsp;
succeeded only in devastating their formerly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.760
flourishing Dnieper lands and in subjecting them&nbsp;
to the rule of Moscow, which gained control of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.360
Ukraine east of the Dnieper and gradually&nbsp;
curtailed our liberties. I had a significant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.240
influence on the history of Ukraine not only&nbsp;
shaping the future of the nation but affecting the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.640
balance of power in Europe, as the weakening of&nbsp;
Poland-Lithuania was exploited by Austria, Saxony,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.000
Prussia, and Russia. My actions were viewed&nbsp;
differently by different contemporaries but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.523
ultimately, I spent my life forging a nation&nbsp;
that I hope is still flourishing to this day.
