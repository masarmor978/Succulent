1
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.770
I am Ota Dokan from Musashi province, current
day Tokyo.

2
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.450
I Was born in “1432”.

3
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.500
I was a Japanese samurai warrior, a poet,
military tactician and Buddhist monk.

4
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.300
I am known as the architect and builder of
Edo Castle which is current day Imperial Palace

5
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.600
in what is today modern Tokyo; and I am considered
the founder of the castle town which grew

6
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.579
up around that Onin era fortress.

7
00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.710
I am also honored to select the site of the
Hikawa Shrine, which is dedicated to the spirit

8
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.570
of poetry and scholarship.

9
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.870
Hikawa Shrine is located very near Edo Castle.

10
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.429
I was also well-read in classical literature;
and like other samurai of my time, I was said

11
00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:53.730
to have been a skilled poet, but only fragments
attributed to me have survived.

12
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.329
One day when I was hunting, it started raining
heavily.

13
00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.090
It happened that there was a hut nearby.

14
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.579
I knocked on the door asking to borrow a straw
raincoat.

15
00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.670
A lady named Benizana came out and handed
me a bundle of yellow mountain roses, and

16
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.670
a poem.

17
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.660
After understanding the depth of that poem,
I devote myself to the study of intellectual

18
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.610
things, such as poetry and architecture.

19
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.780
I am credited with designing and building
Edo Castle for Uesugi Sadamasa in 1457 over

20
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.820
the fortifications Edo Shigenaga had earlier
built.

21
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.220
As a military strategist, I am reputed to
have been an effective tactician; but political

22
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.460
intrigues can be as deadly as any battle.

23
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.650
Despite years of distinguished service, the
Uesugi clan leader proved fickle.

24
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.441
I met an untimely end at Uesugi Sadamasa's
home in Sagami (modern-day Kanagawa) after

25
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:54.630
I was falsely accused of disloyalty during
a period when the Uesugi family struggled

26
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.240
through an internal clan conflict.

27
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.030
I wrote a peom while I was dying that I am
famous for.

28
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.420
After my death, the castle was then abandoned
until it was taken over by Ieyasu in 1590.

29
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.700
My life changed after I read a poem from Benizana
and ended with my own poem.

30
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.590
Between both poems , I added many landmarks
that I hope had bloomed fruitfully in the

31
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.739
Japanese society.
