00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.760
I am Lesya Ukrainka, born in&nbsp;
1871, in Novograd-Volynsky,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.920
Ukraine. I am a poet, dramatist, short-story&nbsp;
writer, essayist, and critic who was the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.640
foremost woman writer in Ukrainian literature&nbsp;
and a leading figure in its modernist movement.&nbsp;

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.440
I am a daughter of intellectuals. I was stricken&nbsp;
with tuberculosis in 1881 and traveled widely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.600
thereafter in search of a cure. My early&nbsp;
lyrical verse, influenced by Taras Shevchenko,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.400
dealt with the poet’s loneliness and social&nbsp;
alienation and was informed by a love of freedom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.120
especially national freedom. The&nbsp;
collections named "On the Wings of Songs”,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.240
“thoughts and Dreams” and “Echoes” established me&nbsp;
as the leading young Ukrainian poet of the day.&nbsp;

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.040
I was active in the Ukrainian struggle&nbsp;
against tsarism and joined Ukrainian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.640
Marxist organizations, translating the&nbsp;
Communist Manifesto into Ukrainian in 1902.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.520
In 1907 I was arrested and, following my release,&nbsp;
was kept under observation by the tsarist police.&nbsp;

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.160
I concentrated on poetic dramas from about&nbsp;
1906. My plays were inspired by various&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.520
historical milieus. Folk songs and fairy tales&nbsp;
provide the framework for my works as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.280
My writings reflected the timeless tension&nbsp;
between exalted ideals and sordid reality.&nbsp;

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.200
Fiction has a special place&nbsp;
in my literary heritage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.360
The first stories from rural life are connected&nbsp;
in content and language with folk songs. My poems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.320
and plays contributed to the establishment of&nbsp;
many aspects within the Ukrainian societies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.920
My involvement in political, civil, and&nbsp;
feminist activism was also significant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.480
in founding modernized Ukrainian literature&nbsp;
for our ongoing struggle for independence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.309
My blade shall sever the fetters of iron&nbsp;
and echo aloud in the forts of all tyrants.
